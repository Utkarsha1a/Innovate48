PS—2 ADDITIONAL DOCUMENTS RELATED TO THE OFFERING OF THE NOTES You should read this pricing supplement together with the prospectus dated May 23, 2022 as supplemented by the documents listed below, relating to our Global Medium-Term Notes, Series A, of which these Notes are a part. This pricing supplement, together with the documents listed below, contains the terms of the Notes and supersedes all prior or contemporaneous oral statements as well as any other written materials including preliminary or indicative pricing terms, correspondence, trade ideas, structures for implementation, sample structures, brochures or other educational materials of ours. You should carefully consider, among other things, the matters set forth under “Risk Factors” in the prospectus supplement and “Selected Risk Considerations” in this pricing supplement, as the Notes involve risks not associated with conventional debt securities. We urge you to consult your investment, legal, tax, accounting and other advisors before you invest in the Notes. You may access these documents on the SEC website at www.sec.gov as follows (or if such address has changed, by reviewing our filings for the relevant date on the SEC website): ● Prospectus dated May 23, 2022: http://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/312070/000119312522157585/d337542df3asr.htm ● Prospectus Supplement dated June 27, 2022: http://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0000312070/000095010322011301/dp169388_424b2-prosupp.htm ● Underlying Supplement dated June 27, 2022: http://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0000312070/000095010322011304/dp169384_424b2-underl.htm Our SEC file number is 1—10257. As used in this pricing supplement, “we,” “us” or “our” refers to Barclays Bank PLC. PS—3 CONSENT TO U.K. BAIL-IN POWER Notwithstanding and to the exclusion of any other term of the Notes or any other agreements, arrangements or understandings between us and any holder or beneficial owner of the Notes (or the Trustee on behalf of the holders of the Notes), by acquiring the Notes, each holder and beneficial owner of the Notes acknowledges, accepts, agrees to be bound by, and consents to the exercise of, any U.K. Bail-in Power by the relevant U.K. resolution authority. Under the U.K. Banking Act 2009, as amended, the relevant U.K. resolution authority may exercise a U.K. Bail-in Power in circumstances in which the relevant U.K. resolution authority is satisfied that the resolution conditions are met. These conditions include that a U.K. bank or investment firm is failing or is likely to fail to satisfy the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 (the “FSMA”) threshold conditions for authorization to carry on certain regulated activities (within the meaning of section 55B FSMA) or, in the case of a U.K. banking group company that is a European Economic Area (“EEA”) or third country institution or investment firm, that the relevant EEA or third country relevant authority is satisfied that the resolution conditions are met in respect of that entity. The U.K. Bail-in Power includes any write-down, conversion, transfer, modification and/or suspension power, which allows for (i) the reduction or cancellation of all, or a portion, of the principal amount of, interest on, or any other amounts payable on, the Notes; (ii) the conversion of all, or a portion, of the principal amount of, interest on, or any other amounts payable on, the Notes into shares or other securities or other obligations of Barclays Bank PLC or another person (and the issue to, or conferral on, the holder or beneficial owner of the Notes such shares, securities or obligations); (iii) the cancellation of the Notes and/or (iv) the amendment or alteration of the maturity of the Notes, or amendment of the amount of interest or any other amounts due on the Notes, or the dates on which interest or any other amounts become payable, including by suspending payment for a temporary period; which U.K. Bail-in Power may be exercised by means of a variation of the terms of the Notes solely to give effect to the exercise by the relevant U.K. resolution authority of such U.K. Bail-in Power. Each holder and beneficial owner of the Notes further acknowledges and agrees that the rights of the holders or beneficial owners of the Notes are subject to, and will be varied, if necessary, solely to give effect to, the exercise of any U.K. Bail-in Power by the relevant U.K. resolution authority. For the avoidance of doubt, this consent and acknowledgment is not a waiver of any rights holders or beneficial owners of the Notes may have at law if and to the extent that any U.K. Bail-in Power is exercised by the relevant U.K. resolution authority in breach of laws applicable in England. For more information, please see “Selected Risk Considerations—Risks Relating to the Issuer—You May Lose Some or All of Your Investment If Any U.K. Bail-in Power Is Exercised by the Relevant U.K. Resolution Authority” in this pricing supplement as well as “U.K. Bail-in Power,” “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to the Securities Generally—Regulatory action in the event a bank or investment firm in the Group is failing or likely to fail, including the exercise by the relevant U.K. resolution authority of a variety of statutory resolution powers, could materially adversely affect the value of any securities” and “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to the Securities Generally—Under the terms of the securities, you have agreed to be bound by the exercise of any U.K. Bail-in Power by the relevant U.K. resolution authority” in the accompanying prospectus supplement. PS—4 ADDITIONAL INFORMATION REGARDING OUR ESTIMATED VALUE OF THE NOTES The range of the estimated values of the Notes referenced above may not correlate on a linear basis with the range of any other term of the Notes as may be set forth in this pricing supplement. We determined the size of such range based on prevailing market conditions, as well as the anticipated duration of the marketing period for the Notes. The final terms for the Notes will be determined on the date the Notes are initially priced for sale to the public, which we refer to as the Initial Valuation Date, based on prevailing market conditions on or prior to the Initial Valuation Date, and will be communicated to investors either orally or in a final pricing supplement. Our internal pricing models take into account a number of variables and are based on a number of subjective assumptions, which may or may not materialize, typically including volatility, interest rates, and our internal funding rates. Our internal funding rates (which are our internally published borrowing rates based on variables such as market benchmarks, our appetite for borrowing, and our existing obligations coming to maturity) may vary from the levels at which our benchmark debt securities trade in the secondary market. Our estimated value on the Initial Valuation Date is based on our internal funding rates. Our estimated value of the Notes may be lower if such valuation were based on the levels at which our benchmark debt securities trade in the secondary market. Our estimated value of the Notes on the Initial Valuation Date is expected to be less than the initial issue price of the Notes. The difference between the initial issue price of the Notes and our estimated value of the Notes is a result of several factors, including any sales commissions to be paid to Barclays Capital Inc. or another affiliate of ours, any selling concessions, discounts, commissions or fees (including any structuring or other distribution related fees) to be allowed or paid to non-affiliated intermediaries, the estimated profit that we or any of our affiliates expect to earn in connection with structuring the Notes, the estimated cost which we may incur in hedging our obligations under the Notes, and estimated development and other costs which we may incur in connection with the Notes. Our estimated value on the Initial Valuation Date is not a prediction of the price at which the Notes may trade in the secondary market, nor will it be the price at which Barclays Capital Inc. may buy or sell the Notes in the secondary market. Subject to normal market and funding conditions, Barclays Capital Inc. or another affiliate of ours intends to offer to purchase the Notes in the secondary market but it is not obligated to do so. Assuming that all relevant factors remain constant after the Initial Valuation Date, the price at which Barclays Capital Inc. may initially buy or sell the Notes in the secondary market, if any, and the value that we may initially use for customer account statements, if we provide any customer account statements at all, may exceed our estimated value on the Initial Valuation Date for a temporary period expected to be approximately three months after the Issue Date because, in our discretion, we may elect to effectively reimburse to investors a portion of the estimated cost of hedging our obligations under the Notes and other costs in connection with the Notes which we will no longer expect to incur over the term of the Notes. We made such discretionary election and determined this temporary reimbursement period on the basis of a number of factors, which may include the tenor of the Notes and/or any agreement we may have with the distributors of the Notes. The amount of our estimated costs which we effectively reimburse to investors in this way may not be allocated ratably throughout the reimbursement period, and we may discontinue such reimbursement at any time or revise the duration of the reimbursement period after the initial Issue Date of the Notes based on changes in market conditions and other factors that cannot be predicted. We urge you to read the “Selected Risk Considerations” beginning on page PS-12 of this pricing supplement. You may revoke your offer to purchase the Notes at any time prior to the Initial Valuation Date. We reserve the right to change the terms of, or reject any offer to purchase, the Notes prior to the Initial Valuation Date. In the event of any changes to the terms of the Notes, we will notify you and you will be asked to accept such changes in connection with your purchase. You may also choose to reject such changes in which case we may reject your offer to purchase. PS—5 SELECTED PURCHASE CONSIDERATIONS The Notes are not suitable for all investors. The Notes may be a suitable investment for you if all of the following statements are true: ● You do not seek an investment that produces fixed periodic interest or coupon payments or other non-contingent sources of current income, and you can tolerate receiving few or no Contingent Coupons over the term of the Notes in the event the Closing Value of any Reference Asset falls below its Coupon Barrier Value on one or more of the specified Observation Dates. ● You understand and accept that you will not participate in any appreciation of any Reference Asset, which may be significant, and that your return potential on the Notes is limited to the Contingent Coupons, if any, paid on the Notes. ● You can tolerate a loss of a significant portion or all of the principal amount of your Notes, and you are willing and able to make an investment that may have the full downside market risk of an investment in the Least Performing Reference Asset. ● You do not anticipate that the Closing Value of any Reference Asset will fall below its Coupon Barrier Value on any Observation Date or below its Barrier Value on the Final Valuation Date. ● You understand and accept that you will not be entitled to receive dividends or distributions that may be paid to holders of any Reference Asset or any securities to which any Reference Asset provides exposure, nor will you have any voting rights with respect to any Reference Asset or any securities to which any Reference Asset provides exposure. ● You are willing and able to accept the individual market risk of each Reference Asset and understand that any decline in the value of one Reference Asset will not be offset or mitigated by a lesser decline or any potential increase in the value of any other Reference Asset. ● You understand and accept the risks that (a) you will not receive a Contingent Coupon if the Closing Value of any Reference Asset is less than its Coupon Barrier Value on an Observation Date and (b) you will lose some or all of your principal at maturity if the Final Value of any Reference Asset is less than its Barrier Value. ● You understand and accept the risk that, if the Notes are not redeemed prior to scheduled maturity, the payment at maturity, if any, will be based solely on the Reference Asset Return of the Least Performing Reference Asset. ● You understand and are willing and able to accept the risks associated with an investment linked to the performance of the Reference Assets. ● You are willing and able to accept the risk that the Notes may be redeemed prior to scheduled maturity and that you may not be able to reinvest your money in an alternative investment with comparable risk and yield. ● You can tolerate fluctuations in the price of the Notes prior to scheduled maturity that may be similar to or exceed the downside fluctuations in the values of the Reference Assets. ● You do not seek an investment for which there will be an active secondary market, and you are willing and able to hold the Notes to maturity if the Notes are not redeemed. ● You are willing and able to assume our credit risk for all payments on the Notes. ● You are willing and able to consent to the exercise of any U.K. Bail-in Power by any relevant U.K. resolution authority. The Notes may not be a suitable investment for you if any of the following statements are true: ● You seek an investment that produces fixed periodic interest or coupon payments or other non-contingent sources of current income, and/or you cannot tolerate receiving few or no Contingent Coupons over the term of the Notes in the event the Closing Value of any Reference Asset falls below its Coupon Barrier Value on one or more of the specified Observation Dates. ● You seek an investment that participates in the full appreciation of any or all of the Reference Assets rather than an investment with a return that is limited to the Contingent Coupons, if any, paid on the Notes. ● You seek an investment that provides for the full repayment of principal at maturity, and/or you are unwilling or unable to accept the risk that you may lose some or all of the principal amount of the Notes in the event that the Final Value of the Least Performing Reference Asset falls below its Barrier Value. ● You anticipate that the Closing Value of at least one Reference Asset will decline during the term of the Notes such that the Closing Value of at least one Reference Asset will fall below its Coupon Barrier Value on one or more Observation Dates and/or the Final Value of at least one Reference Asset will fall below its Barrier Value. ● You are unwilling or unable to accept the individual market risk of each Reference Asset and/or do not understand that any decline in the value of one Reference Asset will not be offset or mitigated by a lesser decline or any potential increase in the value of any other Reference Asset. ● You do not understand and/or are unwilling or unable to accept the risks associated with an investment linked to the performance of the Reference Assets. ● You are unwilling or unable to accept the risk that the negative performance of only one Reference Asset may cause you to not receive Contingent Coupons and/or suffer a loss of principal at maturity, regardless of the performance of any other Reference Asset. ● You are unwilling or unable to accept the risk that the Notes may be redeemed prior to scheduled maturity. ● You seek an investment that entitles you to dividends or distributions on, or voting rights related to any Reference Asset or any securities to which any Reference Asset provides exposure. PS—6 ● You cannot tolerate fluctuations in the price of the Notes prior to scheduled maturity that may be similar to or exceed the downside fluctuations in the values of the Reference Assets. ● You seek an investment for which there will be an active secondary market, and/or you are unwilling or unable to hold the Notes to maturity if the Notes are not redeemed. ● You prefer the lower risk, and therefore accept the potentially lower returns, of fixed income investments with comparable maturities and credit ratings. ● You are unwilling or unable to assume our credit risk for all payments on the Notes. ● You are unwilling or unable to consent to the exercise of any U.K. Bail-in Power by any relevant U.K. resolution authority. You must rely on your own evaluation of the merits of an investment in the Notes. You should reach a decision whether to invest in the Notes after carefully considering, with your advisors, the suitability of the Notes in light of your investment objectives and the specific information set out in this pricing supplement and the documents referenced under “Additional Documents Related to the Offering of the Notes” in this pricing supplement. Neither the Issuer nor Barclays Capital Inc. makes any recommendation as to the suitability of the Notes for investment. PS—7 ADDITIONAL TERMS OF THE NOTES The Observation Dates (including the Final Valuation Date), the Contingent Coupon Payment Dates, any Call Settlement Date and the Maturity Date are subject to postponement in certain circumstances, as described under “Reference Assets—Indices—Market Disruption Events for Securities with an Index of Equity Securities as a Reference Asset,” “Reference Assets—Least or Best Performing Reference Asset—Scheduled Trading Days and Market Disruption Events for Securities Linked to the Reference Asset with the Lowest or Highest Return in a Group of Two or More Equity Securities, Exchange-Traded Funds and/or Indices of Equity Securities” and “Terms of the Notes—Payment Dates” in the accompanying prospectus supplement. In addition, the Reference Assets and the Notes are subject to adjustment by the Calculation Agent under certain circumstances, as described under “Reference Assets—Indices—Adjustments Relating to Securities with an Index as a Reference Asset” in the accompanying prospectus supplement. PS—8 HYPOTHETICAL EXAMPLES OF AMOUNTS PAYABLE ON A SINGLE CONTINGENT COUPON PAYMENT DATE The following examples demonstrate the circumstances under which you may receive a Contingent Coupon on a hypothetical Contingent Coupon Payment Date. The numbers appearing in these tables are purely hypothetical and are provided for illustrative purposes only. These examples do not take into account any tax consequences from investing in the Notes and make the following key assumptions: ■ Hypothetical Initial Value of each Reference Asset: 100.00* ■ Hypothetical Coupon Barrier Value for each Reference Asset: 70.00 (70.00% of the hypothetical Initial Value set forth above)* * The hypothetical Initial Value of 100.00 and the hypothetical Coupon Barrier Value of 70.00 for each Reference Asset have been chosen for illustrative purposes only. The actual Initial Value and Coupon Barrier Value for each Reference Asset are as set forth on the cover of this pricing supplement. Example 1: The Closing Value of each Reference Asset is greater than its Coupon Barrier Value on the relevant Observation Date. Reference Asset Closing Value on Relevant Observation Date SPX Index 100.00 RTY Index 75.00 NDX Index 80.00 Because the Closing Value of each Reference Asset is greater than its respective Coupon Barrier Value, you will receive a Contingent Coupon of $9.875 (0.9875% of the principal amount per Note) on the related Contingent Coupon Payment Date. Example 2: The Closing Value of one Reference Asset is greater than its Coupon Barrier Value on the relevant Observation Date and the Closing Value of at least one Reference Asset is less than its Coupon Barrier Value on the relevant Observation Date. Reference Asset Closing Value on Relevant Observation Date SPX Index 80.00 RTY Index 69.00 NDX Index 50.00 Because the Closing Value of at least one Reference Asset is less than its Coupon Barrier Value, you will not receive a Contingent Coupon on the related Contingent Coupon Payment Date. Example 3: The Closing Value of each Reference Asset is less than its Coupon Barrier Value on the relevant Observation Date. Reference Asset Closing Value on Relevant Observation Date SPX Index 68.00 RTY Index 50.00 NDX Index 45.00 Because the Closing Value of at least one Reference Asset is less than its Coupon Barrier Value, you will not receive a Contingent Coupon on the related Contingent Coupon Payment Date. Examples 2 and 3 demonstrate that you may not receive a Contingent Coupon on a Contingent Coupon Payment Date. If the Closing Value of any Reference Asset is below its Coupon Barrier Value on each Observation Date, you will not receive any Contingent Coupons during the term of the Notes. PS—9 HYPOTHETICAL EXAMPLES OF AMOUNTS PAYABLE AT MATURITY The following table illustrates the hypothetical payment at maturity under various circumstances. The examples set forth below are purely hypothetical and are provided for illustrative purposes only. The numbers appearing in the following table and examples have been rounded for ease of analysis. The hypothetical examples below do not take into account any tax consequences from investing in the Notes and make the following key assumptions: ■ Hypothetical Initial Value of each Reference Asset: 100.00* ■ Hypothetical Coupon Barrier Value for each Reference Asset: 70.00 (70.00% of the hypothetical Initial Value set forth above)* ■ Hypothetical Barrier Value for each Reference Asset: 70.00 (70.00% of the hypothetical Initial Value set forth above)* ■ You hold the Notes to maturity, and the Notes are NOT redeemed prior to scheduled maturity. * The hypothetical Initial Value of 100.00, the hypothetical Coupon Barrier Value of 70.00 and the hypothetical Barrier Value of 70.00 for each Reference Asset have been chosen for illustrative purposes only. The actual Initial Value, Coupon Barrier Value and Barrier Value for each Reference Asset are as set forth on the cover of this pricing supplement.

The following examples illustrate how the payments at maturity set forth in the table above are calculated: Example 1: The Final Value of Reference Asset A is 135.00, the Final Value of Reference Asset B is 130.00 and the Final Value of Reference Asset C is 140.00. Because Reference Asset B has the lowest Reference Asset Return, Reference Asset B is the Least Performing Reference Asset. Because the Final Value of the Least Performing Reference Asset is greater than or equal to its Barrier Value, you will receive a payment at maturity of $1,000 per $1,000 principal amount Note that you hold (plus the Contingent Coupon that will otherwise be payable on the Maturity Date). PS—10 Example 2: The Final Value of Reference Asset A is 140.00, the Final Value of Reference Asset B is 90.00 and the Final Value of Reference Asset C is 105.00. Because Reference Asset B has the lowest Reference Asset Return, Reference Asset B is the Least Performing Reference Asset. Because the Final Value of the Least Performing Reference Asset is greater than or equal to its Barrier Value, you will receive a payment at maturity of $1,000 per $1,000 principal amount Note that you hold (plus the Contingent Coupon that will otherwise be payable on the Maturity Date). Example 3: The Final Value of Reference Asset A is 60.00, the Final Value of Reference Asset B is 120.00 and the Final Value of Reference Asset C is 100.00. Because Reference Asset A has the lowest Reference Asset Return, Reference Asset A is the Least Performing Reference Asset. Because the Final Value of the Least Performing Reference Asset is less than its Barrier Value, you will receive a payment at maturity of $600.00 per $1,000 principal amount Note that you hold, calculated as follows: $1,000 + [$1,000 × Reference Asset Return of the Least Performing Reference Asset] $1,000 + [$1,000 × -40.00%] = $600.00 In addition, because the Final Value of at least one Reference Asset is less than its Coupon Barrier Value, you will not receive a Contingent Coupon on the Maturity Date. Example 3 demonstrates that if the Notes are not redeemed prior to scheduled maturity, and if the Final Value of the Least Performing Reference Asset is less than its Barrier Value, your investment in the Notes will be fully exposed to the decline of the Least Performing Reference Asset from its Initial Value. You will not benefit in any way from the Reference Asset Return of any other Reference Asset being higher than the Reference Asset Return of the Least Performing Reference Asset. If the Notes are not redeemed prior to scheduled maturity, you may lose up to 100.00% of the principal amount of your Notes. Any payment on the Notes, including the repayment of principal, is subject to the credit risk of Barclays Bank PLC. PS—11 SELECTED RISK CONSIDERATIONS An investment in the Notes involves significant risks. Investing in the Notes is not equivalent to investing directly in the Reference Assets or their components, if any. Some of the risks that apply to an investment in the Notes are summarized below, but we urge you to read the more detailed explanation of risks relating to the Notes generally in the “Risk Factors” section of the prospectus supplement. You should not purchase the Notes unless you understand and can bear the risks of investing in the Notes. Risks Relating to the Notes Generally ● Your Investment in the Notes May Result in a Significant Loss — The Notes differ from ordinary debt securities in that the Issuer will not necessarily repay the full principal amount of the Notes at maturity. If the Notes are not redeemed prior to scheduled maturity, and if the Final Value of the Least Performing Reference Asset is less than its Barrier Value, your Notes will be fully exposed to the decline of the Least Performing Reference Asset from its Initial Value. You may lose up to 100.00% of the principal amount of your Notes. ● Potential Return is Limited to the Contingent Coupons, If Any, and You Will Not Participate in Any Appreciation of Any Reference Asset — The potential positive return on the Notes is limited to the Contingent Coupons, if any, that may be payable during the term of the Notes. You will not participate in any appreciation in the value of any Reference Asset, which may be significant, even though you will be exposed to the depreciation in the value of the Least Performing Reference Asset if the Notes are not redeemed and the Final Value of the Least Performing Reference Asset is less than its Barrier Value. ● You May Not Receive Any Contingent Coupon Payments on the Notes — The Issuer will not necessarily make periodic coupon payments on the Notes. You will receive a Contingent Coupon on a Contingent Coupon Payment Date only if the Closing Value of each Reference Asset on the related Observation Date is greater than or equal to its respective Coupon Barrier Value. If the Closing Value of any Reference Asset on an Observation Date is less than its Coupon Barrier Value, you will not receive a Contingent Coupon on the related Contingent Coupon Payment Date. If the Closing Value of at least one Reference Asset is less than its respective Coupon Barrier Value on each Observation Date, you will not receive any Contingent Coupons during the term of the Notes. ● Because the Notes Are Linked to the Least Performing Reference Asset, You Are Exposed to Greater Risks of No Contingent Coupons and Sustaining a Significant Loss of Principal at Maturity Than If the Notes Were Linked to a Single Reference Asset — The risk that you will not receive any Contingent Coupons and lose a significant portion or all of your principal amount in the Notes at maturity is greater if you invest in the Notes as opposed to substantially similar securities that are linked to the performance of a single Reference Asset. With multiple Reference Assets, it is more likely that the Closing Value of at least one Reference Asset will be less than its Coupon Barrier Value on the specified Observation Dates or less than its Barrier Value on the Final Valuation Date, and therefore, it is more likely that you will not receive any Contingent Coupons and that you will suffer a significant loss of principal at maturity. Further, the performance of the Reference Assets may not be correlated or may be negatively correlated. The lower the correlation between multiple Reference Assets, the greater the potential for one of those Reference Assets to close below its Coupon Barrier Value or Barrier Value on an Observation Date or the Final Valuation Date, respectively. It is impossible to predict what the correlation among the Reference Assets will be over the term of the Notes. The Reference Assets represent different equity markets. These different equity markets may not perform similarly over the term of the Notes. Although the correlation of the Reference Assets’ performance may change over the term of the Notes, the Contingent Coupon rate is determined, in part, based on the correlation of the Reference Assets’ performance calculated using our internal models at the time when the terms of the Notes are finalized. A higher Contingent Coupon is generally associated with lower correlation of the Reference Assets, which reflects a greater potential for missed Contingent Coupons and for a loss of principal at maturity. ● You Are Exposed to the Market Risk of Each Reference Asset — Your return on the Notes is not linked to a basket consisting of the Reference Assets. Rather, it will be contingent upon the independent performance of each Reference Asset. Unlike an instrument with a return linked to a basket of underlying assets in which risk is mitigated and diversified among all the components of the basket, you will be exposed to the risks related to each Reference Asset. Poor performance by any Reference Asset over the term of the Notes may negatively affect your return and will not be offset or mitigated by any increases or lesser declines in the value of any other Reference Asset. To receive a Contingent Coupon, the Closing Value of each Reference Asset must be greater than or equal to its Coupon Barrier Value on the applicable Observation Date. In addition, if the Notes have not been redeemed prior to scheduled maturity, and if the Final Value of any Reference Asset is less than its Barrier Value, you will be exposed to the full decline in the Least Performing Reference Asset from its Initial Value. Accordingly, your investment is subject to the market risk of each Reference Asset. ● The Notes Are Subject to Volatility Risk — Volatility is a measure of the degree of variation in the price of an asset (or level of an index) over a period of time. The amount of any coupon payments that may be payable under the Notes is based on a number of factors, including the expected volatility of the Reference Assets. The amount of such coupon payments will be paid at a per annum rate that is higher than the fixed rate that we would pay on a conventional debt security of the same tenor and is higher than it otherwise would have been had the expected volatility of the Reference Assets been lower. As volatility of a Reference Asset increases, there will typically be a greater likelihood that (a) the Closing Value of that Reference Asset on one or more Observation Dates will be less than its Coupon Barrier Value and (b) the Final Value of that Reference Asset will be less than its Barrier Value. PS—12 Accordingly, you should understand that a higher coupon payment amount reflects, among other things, an indication of a greater likelihood that you will (a) not receive coupon payments with respect to one or more Observation Dates and/or (b) incur a loss of principal at maturity than would have been the case had the amount of such coupon payments been lower. In addition, actual volatility over the term of the Notes may be significantly higher than the expected volatility at the time the terms of the Notes were determined. If actual volatility is higher than expected, you will face an even greater risk that you will not receive coupon payments and/or that you will lose some or all of your principal at maturity for the reasons described above. ● Early Redemption and Reinvestment Risk — While the original term of the Notes is as indicated on the cover of this pricing supplement, the Notes may be redeemed prior to maturity, as described above, and the holding period over which you may receive any coupon payments that may be payable under the Notes could be as short as approximately three months. The Redemption Price that you would receive on a Call Settlement Date, together with any coupon payments that you may have received prior to the Call Settlement Date, may be less than the aggregate amount of payments that you would have received had the Notes not been redeemed. There is no guarantee that you would be able to reinvest the proceeds from an investment in the Notes in a comparable investment with a similar level of risk in the event the Notes are redeemed prior to the Maturity Date. No additional payments will be due after the relevant Call Settlement Date. The fact that the Notes may be redeemed prior to maturity may also adversely impact your ability to sell your Notes and the price at which they may be sold. It is more likely that we will redeem the Notes at our sole discretion prior to maturity to the extent that the expected interest payable on the Notes is greater than the interest that would be payable on other instruments issued by us of comparable maturity, terms and credit rating trading in the market. We are less likely to redeem the Notes prior to maturity when the expected interest payable on the Notes is less than the interest that would be payable on other comparable instruments issued by us, which includes when the value of any Reference Asset is less than its Coupon Barrier Value. Therefore, the Notes are more likely to remain outstanding when the expected interest payable on the Notes is less than what would be payable on other comparable instruments and when your risk of not receiving a Contingent Coupon is relatively higher. ● Any Payment on the Notes Will Be Determined Based on the Closing Values of the Reference Assets on the Dates Specified — Any payment on the Notes will be determined based on the Closing Values of the Reference Assets on the dates specified. You will not benefit from any more favorable values of the Reference Assets determined at any other time. ● Contingent Repayment of Any Principal Amount Applies Only at Maturity or upon Any Redemption — You should be willing to hold your Notes to maturity or any redemption. Although the Notes provide for the contingent repayment of the principal amount of your Notes at maturity, provided that the Final Value of the Least Performing Reference Asset is greater than or equal to its Barrier Value, or upon any redemption, if you sell your Notes prior to such time in the secondary market, if any, you may have to sell your Notes at a price that is less than the principal amount even if at that time the value of each Reference Asset has increased from its Initial Value. See “Many Economic and Market Factors Will Impact the Value of the Notes” below. ● Owning the Notes is Not the Same as Owning Any Reference Asset or Any Securities to which Any Reference Asset Provides Exposure — The return on the Notes may not reflect the return you would realize if you actually owned any Reference Asset or any securities to which any Reference Asset provides exposure. As a holder of the Notes, you will not have voting rights or rights to receive dividends or other distributions or any other rights that holders of any Reference Asset or any securities to which any Reference Asset provides exposure may have. ● Tax Treatment — Significant aspects of the tax treatment of the Notes are uncertain. You should consult your tax advisor about your tax situation. See “Tax Considerations” below. Risks Relating to the Issuer ● Credit of Issuer — The Notes are unsecured and unsubordinated debt obligations of the Issuer, Barclays Bank PLC, and are not, either directly or indirectly, an obligation of any third party. Any payment to be made on the Notes, including any repayment of principal, is subject to the ability of Barclays Bank PLC to satisfy its obligations as they come due and is not guaranteed by any third party. As a result, the actual and perceived creditworthiness of Barclays Bank PLC may affect the market value of the Notes, and in the event Barclays Bank PLC were to default on its obligations, you may not receive any amounts owed to you under the terms of the Notes. ● You May Lose Some or All of Your Investment If Any U.K. Bail-in Power Is Exercised by the Relevant U.K. Resolution Authority — Notwithstanding and to the exclusion of any other term of the Notes or any other agreements, arrangements or understandings between Barclays Bank PLC and any holder or beneficial owner of the Notes (or the Trustee on behalf of the holders of the Notes), by acquiring the Notes, each holder and beneficial owner of the Notes acknowledges, accepts, agrees to be bound by, and consents to the exercise of, any U.K. Bail-in Power by the relevant U.K. resolution authority as set forth under “Consent to U.K. Bail-in Power” in this pricing supplement. Accordingly, any U.K. Bail-in Power may be exercised in such a manner as to result in you and other holders and beneficial owners of the Notes losing all or a part of the value of your investment in the Notes or receiving a different security from the Notes, which may be worth significantly less than the Notes and which may have significantly fewer protections than those typically afforded to debt securities. Moreover, the relevant U.K. resolution authority may exercise the U.K. Bail-in Power without providing any advance notice to, or requiring the consent of, the holders and beneficial owners of the Notes. The exercise of any U.K. Bail-in Power by the relevant U.K. resolution authority with respect to the Notes will not be a default or an Event of Default (as each term is defined in the senior debt securities indenture) and the trustee will not be liable for any action that the trustee takes, or abstains from taking, in either PS—13 case, in accordance with the exercise of the U.K. Bail-in Power by the relevant U.K. resolution authority with respect to the Notes. See “Consent to U.K. Bail-in Power” in this pricing supplement as well as “U.K. Bail-in Power,” “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to the Securities Generally—Regulatory action in the event a bank or investment firm in the Group is failing or likely to fail, including the exercise by the relevant U.K. resolution authority of a variety of statutory resolution powers, could materially adversely affect the value of any securities” and “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to the Securities Generally—Under the terms of the securities, you have agreed to be bound by the exercise of any U.K. Bail-in Power by the relevant U.K. resolution authority” in the accompanying prospectus supplement. Risks Relating to the Reference Assets ● Historical Performance of the Reference Assets Should Not Be Taken as Any Indication of the Future Performance of the Reference Assets Over the Term of the Notes — The value of each Reference Asset has fluctuated in the past and may, in the future, experience significant fluctuations. The historical performance of a Reference Asset is not an indication of the future performance of that Reference Asset over the term of the Notes. The historical correlation among the Reference Assets is not an indication of the future correlation among them over the term of the Notes. Therefore, the performance of the Reference Assets individually or in comparison to each other over the term of the Notes may bear no relation or resemblance to the historical performance of any Reference Asset. ● Each Reference Asset Reflects the Price Return of the Securities Composing that Reference Asset, Not the Total Return — The return on the Notes is based on the performance of the Reference Assets, which reflects changes in the market prices of the securities composing the Reference Assets. The Reference Assets are not \"total return\" indices that, in addition to reflecting those price returns, would also reflect dividends paid on the securities composing that Reference Asset. Accordingly, the return on the Notes will not include such a total return feature. ● Adjustments to Any Reference Asset Could Adversely Affect the Value of the Notes — The sponsor of any Reference Asset may add, delete, substitute or adjust the securities composing that Reference Asset or make other methodological changes to that Reference Asset that could affect its value. The Calculation Agent will calculate the value to be used as the Closing Value of that Reference Asset in the event of certain material changes in or modifications to that Reference Asset. In addition, the sponsor of any Reference Asset may also discontinue or suspend calculation or publication of that Reference Asset at any time. Under these circumstances, the Calculation Agent may select a successor index that the Calculation Agent determines to be comparable to that Reference Asset or, if no successor index is available, the Calculation Agent will determine the value to be used as the Closing Value of that Reference Asset. Any of these actions could adversely affect the value of any Reference Asset and, consequently, the value of the Notes. See “Reference Assets—Indices—Adjustments Relating to Securities with an Index as a Reference Asset” in the accompanying prospectus supplement. ● The Notes Are Subject to Risks Associated with Non-U.S. Securities Markets — Certain component securities of the NDX Index are issued by non-U.S. companies in non-U.S. securities markets. Investments in securities linked to the value of such non-U.S. equity securities, such as the Notes, involve risks associated with the securities markets in the home countries of the issuers of those non-U.S. equity securities, including risks of volatility in those markets, governmental intervention in those markets and cross shareholdings in companies in certain countries. Also, there is generally less publicly available information about companies in some of these jurisdictions than there is about U.S. companies that are subject to the reporting requirements of the SEC, and generally non-U.S. companies are subject to accounting, auditing and financial reporting standards and requirements and securities trading rules different from those applicable to U.S. reporting companies. The prices of securities in non-U.S. markets may be affected by political, economic, financial and social factors in those countries, or global regions, including changes in government, economic and fiscal policies and currency exchange laws. ● The Notes Are Subject to Risks Associated with Small Capitalization Stocks — The RTY Index tracks companies that are considered small-capitalization companies. These companies often have greater stock price volatility, lower trading volume and less liquidity than large-capitalization companies, and therefore securities linked to the RTY Index may be more volatile than an investment linked to an index with component stocks issued by large-capitalization companies. Stock prices of small-capitalization companies are also more vulnerable than those of large-capitalization companies to adverse business and economic developments. In addition, small-capitalization companies are typically less stable financially than large-capitalization companies and may depend on a small number of key personnel, making them more vulnerable to loss of personnel. Small-capitalization companies are often subject to less analyst coverage and may be in early, and less predictable, periods of their corporate existences. Such companies tend to have smaller revenues, less diverse product lines, smaller shares of their product or service markets, fewer financial resources and less competitive strengths than large-capitalization companies and are more susceptible to adverse developments related to their products. Risks Relating to Conflicts of Interest ● We and Our Affiliates May Engage in Various Activities or Make Determinations That Could Materially Affect the Notes in Various Ways and Create Conflicts of Interest — We and our affiliates play a variety of roles in connection with the issuance of the Notes, as described below. In performing these roles, our and our affiliates’ economic interests are potentially adverse to your interests as an investor in the Notes. In connection with our normal business activities and in connection with hedging our obligations under the Notes, we and our affiliates make markets in and trade various financial instruments or products for our accounts and for the account of our clients and otherwise provide investment banking and other financial services with respect to these financial instruments and products. PS—14 These financial instruments and products may include securities, derivative instruments or assets that may relate to the Reference Assets or their components, if any. In any such market making, trading and hedging activity, and other financial services, we or our affiliates may take positions or take actions that are inconsistent with, or adverse to, the investment objectives of the holders of the Notes. We and our affiliates have no obligation to take the needs of any buyer, seller or holder of the Notes into account in conducting these activities. Such market making, trading and hedging activity, investment banking and other financial services may negatively impact the value of the Notes. In addition, the role played by Barclays Capital Inc., as the agent for the Notes, could present significant conflicts of interest with the role of Barclays Bank PLC, as issuer of the Notes. For example, Barclays Capital Inc. or its representatives may derive compensation or financial benefit from the distribution of the Notes and such compensation or financial benefit may serve as incentive to sell the Notes instead of other investments. Furthermore, we and our affiliates establish the offering price of the Notes for initial sale to the public, and the offering price is not based upon any independent verification or valuation. In addition to the activities described above, we will also act as the Calculation Agent for the Notes. As Calculation Agent, we will determine any values of the Reference Assets and make any other determinations necessary to calculate any payments on the Notes. In making these determinations, the Calculation Agent may be required to make discretionary judgements relating to the Reference Assets, including determining whether a market disruption event has occurred or whether certain adjustments to the Reference Assets or other terms of the Notes are necessary, as further described in the accompanying prospectus supplement. In making these discretionary judgments, our economic interests are potentially adverse to your interests as an investor in the Notes, and any of these determinations may adversely affect any payments on the Notes. Risks Relating to the Estimated Value of the Notes and the Secondary Market ● The Estimated Value of Your Notes is Expected to be Lower Than the Initial Issue Price of Your Notes — The estimated value of your Notes on the Initial Valuation Date is expected to be lower, and may be significantly lower, than the initial issue price of your Notes. The difference between the initial issue price of your Notes and the estimated value of the Notes is a result of certain factors, such as any sales commissions to be paid to Barclays Capital Inc. or another affiliate of ours, any selling concessions, discounts, commissions or fees (including any structuring or other distribution related fees) to be allowed or paid to non-affiliated intermediaries, the estimated profit that we or any of our affiliates expect to earn in connection with structuring the Notes, the estimated cost which we may incur in hedging our obligations under the Notes, and estimated development and other costs which we may incur in connection with the Notes. ● The Estimated Value of Your Notes Might be Lower if Such Estimated Value Were Based on the Levels at Which Our Debt Securities Trade in the Secondary Market — The estimated value of your Notes on the Initial Valuation Date is based on a number of variables, including our internal funding rates. Our internal funding rates may vary from the levels at which our benchmark debt securities trade in the secondary market. As a result of this difference, the estimated value referenced above might be lower if such estimated value were based on the levels at which our benchmark debt securities trade in the secondary market. ● The Estimated Value of the Notes is Based on Our Internal Pricing Models, Which May Prove to be Inaccurate and May be Different from the Pricing Models of Other Financial Institutions — The estimated value of your Notes on the Initial Valuation Date is based on our internal pricing models, which take into account a number of variables and are based on a number of subjective assumptions, which may or may not materialize. These variables and assumptions are not evaluated or verified on an independent basis. Further, our pricing models may be different from other financial institutions’ pricing models and the methodologies used by us to estimate the value of the Notes may not be consistent with those of other financial institutions which may be purchasers or sellers of Notes in the secondary market. As a result, the secondary market price of your Notes may be materially different from the estimated value of the Notes determined by reference to our internal pricing models. ● The Estimated Value of Your Notes Is Not a Prediction of the Prices at Which You May Sell Your Notes in the Secondary Market, if any, and Such Secondary Market Prices, If Any, Will Likely be Lower Than the Initial Issue Price of Your Notes and May be Lower Than the Estimated Value of Your Notes — The estimated value of the Notes will not be a prediction of the prices at which Barclays Capital Inc., other affiliates of ours or third parties may be willing to purchase the Notes from you in secondary market transactions (if they are willing to purchase, which they are not obligated to do). The price at which you may be able to sell your Notes in the secondary market at any time will be influenced by many factors that cannot be predicted, such as market conditions, and any bid and ask spread for similar sized trades, and may be substantially less than our estimated value of the Notes. Further, as secondary market prices of your Notes take into account the levels at which our debt securities trade in the secondary market, and do not take into account our various costs related to the Notes such as fees, commissions, discounts, and the costs of hedging our obligations under the Notes, secondary market prices of your Notes will likely be lower than the initial issue price of your Notes. As a result, the price at which Barclays Capital Inc., other affiliates of ours or third parties may be willing to purchase the Notes from you in secondary market transactions, if any, will likely be lower than the price you paid for your Notes, and any sale prior to the Maturity Date could result in a substantial loss to you. ● The Temporary Price at Which We May Initially Buy The Notes in the Secondary Market And the Value We May Initially Use for Customer Account Statements, If We Provide Any Customer Account Statements At All, May Not Be Indicative of Future Prices of Your Notes — Assuming that all relevant factors remain constant after the Initial Valuation Date, the price at which Barclays Capital Inc. may initially buy or sell the Notes in the secondary market (if Barclays Capital Inc. makes a market in the Notes, which it is not obligated to do) and the value that we may initially use for customer account PS—15 statements, if we provide any customer account statements at all, may exceed our estimated value of the Notes on the Initial Valuation Date, as well as the secondary market value of the Notes, for a temporary period after the initial Issue Date of the Notes. The price at which Barclays Capital Inc. may initially buy or sell the Notes in the secondary market and the value that we may initially use for customer account statements may not be indicative of future prices of your Notes. ● Lack of Liquidity — The Notes will not be listed on any securities exchange. Barclays Capital Inc. and other affiliates of Barclays Bank PLC intend to make a secondary market for the Notes but are not required to do so, and may discontinue any such secondary market making at any time, without notice. Barclays Capital Inc. may at any time hold unsold inventory, which may inhibit the development of a secondary market for the Notes. Even if there is a secondary market, it may not provide enough liquidity to allow you to trade or sell the Notes easily. Because other dealers are not likely to make a secondary market for the Notes, the price at which you may be able to trade your Notes is likely to depend on the price, if any, at which Barclays Capital Inc. and other affiliates of Barclays Bank PLC are willing to buy the Notes. The Notes are not designed to be short-term trading instruments. Accordingly, you should be willing and able to hold your Notes to maturity. ● Many Economic and Market Factors Will Impact the Value of the Notes — The value of the Notes will be affected by a number of economic and market factors that interact in complex and unpredictable ways and that may either offset or magnify each other, including: o the market price of, dividend rate on and expected volatility of the Reference Assets or the components of the Reference Assets, if any; o correlation (or lack of correlation) of the Reference Assets; o the time to maturity of the Notes; o interest and yield rates in the market generally; o a variety of economic, financial, political, regulatory or judicial events; o supply and demand for the Notes; and o our creditworthiness, including actual or anticipated downgrades in our credit ratings.

Historical Performance of the Nasdaq-100 Index® PAST PERFORMANCE IS NOT INDICATIVE OF FUTURE RESULTS PS—19 TAX CONSIDERATIONS You should review carefully the sections in the accompanying prospectus supplement entitled “Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences—Tax Consequences to U.S. Holders—Notes Treated as Prepaid Forward or Derivative Contracts with Associated Contingent Coupons” and, if you are a non-U.S. holder, “—Tax Consequences to Non-U.S. Holders.” The following discussion supersedes the discussion in the accompanying prospectus supplement to the extent it is inconsistent therewith. In determining our reporting responsibilities, if any, we intend to treat (i) the Notes for U.S. federal income tax purposes as prepaid forward contracts with associated contingent coupons and (ii) any Contingent Coupon payments as ordinary income, as described in the section entitled “Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences—Tax Consequences to U.S. Holders—Notes Treated as Prepaid Forward or Derivative Contracts with Associated Contingent Coupons” in the accompanying prospectus supplement. Our special tax counsel, Davis Polk & Wardwell LLP, has advised that it believes this treatment to be reasonable, but that there are other reasonable treatments that the Internal Revenue Service (the “IRS”) or a court may adopt. Sale, exchange or redemption of a Note. Assuming the treatment described above is respected, upon a sale or exchange of the Notes (including upon early redemption or redemption at maturity), you should recognize capital gain or loss equal to the difference between the amount realized on the sale or exchange and your tax basis in the Notes, which should equal the amount you paid to acquire the Notes (assuming Contingent Coupon payments are properly treated as ordinary income, consistent with the position referred to above). This gain or loss should be short-term capital gain or loss unless you hold the Notes for more than one year, in which case the gain or loss should be long-term capital gain or loss, whether or not you are an initial purchaser of the Notes at the issue price. The deductibility of capital losses is subject to limitations. If you sell your Notes between the time your right to a Contingent Coupon payment is fixed and the time it is paid, it is likely that you will be treated as receiving ordinary income equal to the Contingent Coupon payment. Although uncertain, it is possible that proceeds received from the sale or exchange of your Notes prior to an Observation Date but that can be attributed to an expected Contingent Coupon payment could be treated as ordinary income. You should consult your tax advisor regarding this issue. As noted above, there are other reasonable treatments that the IRS or a court may adopt, in which case the timing and character of any income or loss on the Notes could be materially affected. In addition, in 2007 the U.S. Treasury Department and the IRS released a notice requesting comments on the U.S. federal income tax treatment of “prepaid forward contracts” and similar instruments. The notice focuses in particular on whether to require investors in these instruments to accrue income over the term of their investment. It also asks for comments on a number of related topics, including the character of income or loss with respect to these instruments and the relevance of factors such as the nature of the underlying property to which the instruments are linked. While the notice requests comments on appropriate transition rules and effective dates, any Treasury regulations or other guidance promulgated after consideration of these issues could materially affect the tax consequences of an investment in the Notes, possibly with retroactive effect. You should consult your tax advisor regarding the U.S. federal income tax consequences of an investment in the Notes, including possible alternative treatments and the issues presented by this notice. Non-U.S. holders. Insofar as we have responsibility as a withholding agent, we do not currently intend to treat Contingent Coupon payments to non-U.S. holders (as defined in the accompanying prospectus supplement) as subject to U.S. withholding tax. However, non-U.S. holders should in any event expect to be required to provide appropriate Forms W-8 or other documentation in order to establish an exemption from backup withholding, as described under the heading “—Information Reporting and Backup Withholding” in the accompanying prospectus supplement. If any withholding is required, we will not be required to pay any additional amounts with respect to amounts withheld. Treasury regulations under Section 871(m) generally impose a withholding tax on certain “dividend equivalents” under certain “equity linked instruments.” A recent IRS notice excludes from the scope of Section 871(m) instruments issued prior to January 1, 2025 that do not have a “delta of one” with respect to underlying securities that could pay U.S.-source dividends for U.S. federal income tax purposes (each an “Underlying Security”). Based on our determination that the Notes do not have a “delta of one” within the meaning of the regulations, we expect that these regulations will not apply to the Notes with regard to non-U.S. holders. Our determination is not binding on the IRS, and the IRS may disagree with this determination. Section 871(m) is complex and its application may depend on your particular circumstances, including whether you enter into other transactions with respect to an Underlying Security. If necessary, further information regarding the potential application of Section 871(m) will be provided in the pricing supplement for the Notes. You should consult your tax advisor regarding the potential application of Section 871(m) to the Notes. PS—20 SUPPLEMENTAL PLAN OF DISTRIBUTION We will agree to sell to Barclays Capital Inc. (the “Agent”), and the Agent will agree to purchase from us, the principal amount of the Notes, and at the price, specified on the cover of this pricing supplement.

You should carefully consider, among other things, the matters set forth under “Risk Factors” in the prospectus supplement and “Selected Risk Considerations” in this pricing supplement, as the Notes involve risks not associated with conventional debt securities. We urge you to consult your investment, legal, tax, accounting and other advisors before you invest in the Notes.

PS—3 CONSENT TO U.K. BAIL-IN POWER Notwithstanding and to the exclusion of any other term of the Notes or any other agreements, arrangements or understandings between us and any holder or beneficial owner of the Notes (or the Trustee on behalf of the holders of the Notes), by acquiring the Notes, each holder and beneficial owner of the Notes acknowledges, accepts, agrees to be bound by, and consents to the exercise of, any U.K. Bail-in Power by the relevant U.K. resolution authority. Under the U.K. Banking Act 2009, as amended, the relevant U.K. resolution authority may exercise a U.K. Bail-in Power in circumstances in which the relevant U.K. resolution authority is satisfied that the resolution conditions are met. These conditions include that a U.K. bank or investment firm is failing or is likely to fail to satisfy the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 (the “FSMA”) threshold conditions for authorization to carry on certain regulated activities (within the meaning of section 55B FSMA) or, in the case of a U.K. banking group company that is a European Economic Area (“EEA”) or third country institution or investment firm, that the relevant EEA or third country relevant authority is satisfied that the resolution conditions are met in respect of that entity. The U.K. Bail-in Power includes any write-down, conversion, transfer, modification and/or suspension power, which allows for (i) the reduction or cancellation of all, or a portion, of the principal amount of, interest on, or any other amounts payable on, the Notes; (ii) the conversion of all, or a portion, of the principal amount of, interest on, or any other amounts payable on, the Notes into shares or other securities or other obligations of Barclays Bank PLC or another person (and the issue to, or conferral on, the holder or beneficial owner of the Notes such shares, securities or obligations); (iii) the cancellation of the Notes and/or (iv) the amendment or alteration of the maturity of the Notes, or amendment of the amount of interest or any other amounts due on the Notes, or the dates on which interest or any other amounts become payable, including by suspending payment for a temporary period; which U.K. Bail-in Power may be exercised by means of a variation of the terms of the Notes solely to give effect to the exercise by the relevant U.K. resolution authority of such U.K. Bail-in Power. Each holder and beneficial owner of the Notes further acknowledges and agrees that the rights of the holders or beneficial owners of the Notes are subject to, and will be varied, if necessary, solely to give effect to, the exercise of any U.K. Bail-in Power by the relevant U.K. resolution authority. For the avoidance of doubt, this consent and acknowledgment is not a waiver of any rights holders or beneficial owners of the Notes may have at law if and to the extent that any U.K. Bail-in Power is exercised by the relevant U.K. resolution authority in breach of laws applicable in England. For more information, please see “Selected Risk Considerations—Risks Relating to the Issuer—You May Lose Some or All of Your Investment If Any U.K. Bail-in Power Is Exercised by the Relevant U.K. Resolution Authority” in this pricing supplement as well as “U.K. Bail-in Power,” “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to the Securities Generally—Regulatory action in the event a bank or investment firm in the Group is failing or likely to fail, including the exercise by the relevant U.K. resolution authority of a variety of statutory resolution powers, could materially adversely affect the value of any securities” and “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to the Securities Generally—Under the terms of the securities, you have agreed to be bound by the exercise of any U.K. Bail-in Power by the relevant U.K. resolution authority” in the accompanying prospectus supplement. PS—4 ADDITIONAL INFORMATION REGARDING OUR ESTIMATED VALUE OF THE NOTES The range of the estimated values of the Notes referenced above may not correlate on a linear basis with the range of any other term of the Notes as may be set forth in this pricing supplement. We determined the size of such range based on prevailing market conditions, as well as the anticipated duration of the marketing period for the Notes. The final terms for the Notes will be determined on the date the Notes are initially priced for sale to the public, which we refer to as the Initial Valuation Date, based on prevailing market conditions on or prior to the Initial Valuation Date, and will be communicated to investors either orally or in a final pricing supplement. Our internal pricing models take into account a number of variables and are based on a number of subjective assumptions, which may or may not materialize, typically including volatility, interest rates, and our internal funding rates. Our internal funding rates (which are our internally published borrowing rates based on variables such as market benchmarks, our appetite for borrowing, and our existing obligations coming to maturity) may vary from the levels at which our benchmark debt securities trade in the secondary market. Our estimated value on the Initial Valuation Date is based on our internal funding rates. Our estimated value of the Notes may be lower if such valuation were based on the levels at which our benchmark debt securities trade in the secondary market. Our estimated value of the Notes on the Initial Valuation Date is expected to be less than the initial issue price of the Notes. The difference between the initial issue price of the Notes and our estimated value of the Notes is a result of several factors, including any sales commissions to be paid to Barclays Capital Inc. or another affiliate of ours, any selling concessions, discounts, commissions or fees (including any structuring or other distribution related fees) to be allowed or paid to non-affiliated intermediaries, the estimated profit that we or any of our affiliates expect to earn in connection with structuring the Notes, the estimated cost which we may incur in hedging our obligations under the Notes, and estimated development and other costs which we may incur in connection with the Notes. Our estimated value on the Initial Valuation Date is not a prediction of the price at which the Notes may trade in the secondary market, nor will it be the price at which Barclays Capital Inc. may buy or sell the Notes in the secondary market. Subject to normal market and funding conditions, Barclays Capital Inc. or another affiliate of ours intends to offer to purchase the Notes in the secondary market but it is not obligated to do so. Assuming that all relevant factors remain constant after the Initial Valuation Date, the price at which Barclays Capital Inc. may initially buy or sell the Notes in the secondary market, if any, and the value that we may initially use for customer account statements, if we provide any customer account statements at all, may exceed our estimated value on the Initial Valuation Date for a temporary period expected to be approximately six months after the Issue Date because, in our discretion, we may elect to effectively reimburse to investors a portion of the estimated cost of hedging our obligations under the Notes and other costs in connection with the Notes which we will no longer expect to incur over the term of the Notes. We made such discretionary election and determined this temporary reimbursement period on the basis of a number of factors, which may include the tenor of the Notes and/or any agreement we may have with the distributors of the Notes. The amount of our estimated costs which we effectively reimburse to investors in this way may not be allocated ratably throughout the reimbursement period, and we may discontinue such reimbursement at any time or revise the duration of the reimbursement period after the initial Issue Date of the Notes based on changes in market conditions and other factors that cannot be predicted. We urge you to read the “Selected Risk Considerations” beginning on page PS-14 of this pricing supplement. You may revoke your offer to purchase the Notes at any time prior to the Initial Valuation Date. We reserve the right to change the terms of, or reject any offer to purchase, the Notes prior to the Initial Valuation Date. In the event of any changes to the terms of the Notes, we will notify you and you will be asked to accept such changes in connection with your purchase. You may also choose to reject such changes in which case we may reject your offer to purchase. PS—5 SELECTED PURCHASE CONSIDERATIONS The Notes are not suitable for all investors. The Notes may be a suitable investment for you if all of the following statements are true: ● You do not seek an investment that produces fixed periodic interest or coupon payments or other non-contingent sources of current income, and you can tolerate receiving few or no Contingent Coupons over the term of the Notes in the event the Closing Value of any Reference Asset falls below its Coupon Barrier Value on one or more of the specified Observation Dates. ● You understand and accept that you will not participate in any appreciation of any Reference Asset, which may be significant, and that your return potential on the Notes is limited to the Contingent Coupons, if any, paid on the Notes. ● You can tolerate a loss of a significant portion or all of the principal amount of your Notes, and you are willing and able to make an investment that may have the full downside market risk of an investment in the Least Performing Reference Asset. ● You do not anticipate that the Closing Value of any Reference Asset will fall below its Coupon Barrier Value on any Observation Date or below its Barrier Value on the Final Valuation Date. ● You understand and accept that you will not be entitled to receive dividends or distributions that may be paid to holders of any Reference Asset or any securities to which any Reference Asset provides exposure, nor will you have any voting rights with respect to any Reference Asset or any securities to which any Reference Asset provides exposure. ● You are willing and able to accept the individual market risk of each Reference Asset and understand that any decline in the value of one Reference Asset will not be offset or mitigated by a lesser decline or any potential increase in the value of any other Reference Asset. ● You understand and accept the risks that (a) you will not receive a Contingent Coupon if the Closing Value of any Reference Asset is less than its Coupon Barrier Value on an Observation Date and (b) you will lose some or all of your principal at maturity if the Final Value of any Reference Asset is less than its Barrier Value. ● You understand and accept the risk that, if the Notes are not redeemed prior to scheduled maturity, the payment at maturity, if any, will be based solely on the Reference Asset Return of the Least Performing Reference Asset. ● You understand and are willing and able to accept the risks associated with an investment linked to the performance of the Reference Assets. ● You are willing and able to accept the risk that the Notes may be redeemed prior to scheduled maturity and that you may not be able to reinvest your money in an alternative investment with comparable risk and yield. ● You can tolerate fluctuations in the price of the Notes prior to scheduled maturity that may be similar to or exceed the downside fluctuations in the values of the Reference Assets. ● You do not seek an investment for which there will be an active secondary market, and you are willing and able to hold the Notes to maturity if the Notes are not redeemed. ● You are willing and able to assume our credit risk for all payments on the Notes. ● You are willing and able to consent to the exercise of any U.K. Bail-in Power by any relevant U.K. resolution authority. The Notes may not be a suitable investment for you if any of the following statements are true: ● You seek an investment that produces fixed periodic interest or coupon payments or other non-contingent sources of current income, and/or you cannot tolerate receiving few or no Contingent Coupons over the term of the Notes in the event the Closing Value of any Reference Asset falls below its Coupon Barrier Value on one or more of the specified Observation Dates. ● You seek an investment that participates in the full appreciation of any or all of the Reference Assets rather than an investment with a return that is limited to the Contingent Coupons, if any, paid on the Notes. ● You seek an investment that provides for the full repayment of principal at maturity, and/or you are unwilling or unable to accept the risk that you may lose some or all of the principal amount of the Notes in the event that the Final Value of the Least Performing Reference Asset falls below its Barrier Value. ● You anticipate that the Closing Value of at least one Reference Asset will decline during the term of the Notes such that the Closing Value of at least one Reference Asset will fall below its Coupon Barrier Value on one or more Observation Dates and/or the Final Value of at least one Reference Asset will fall below its Barrier Value. ● You are unwilling or unable to accept the individual market risk of each Reference Asset and/or do not understand that any decline in the value of one Reference Asset will not be offset or mitigated by a lesser decline or any potential increase in the value of any other Reference Asset. ● You do not understand and/or are unwilling or unable to accept the risks associated with an investment linked to the performance of the Reference Assets. ● You are unwilling or unable to accept the risk that the negative performance of only one Reference Asset may cause you to not receive Contingent Coupons and/or suffer a loss of principal at maturity, regardless of the performance of any other Reference Asset. ● You are unwilling or unable to accept the risk that the Notes may be redeemed prior to scheduled maturity. ● You seek an investment that entitles you to dividends or distributions on, or voting rights related to any Reference Asset or any securities to which any Reference Asset provides exposure. PS—6 ● You cannot tolerate fluctuations in the price of the Notes prior to scheduled maturity that may be similar to or exceed the downside fluctuations in the values of the Reference Assets. ● You seek an investment for which there will be an active secondary market, and/or you are unwilling or unable to hold the Notes to maturity if the Notes are not redeemed. ● You prefer the lower risk, and therefore accept the potentially lower returns, of fixed income investments with comparable maturities and credit ratings. ● You are unwilling or unable to assume our credit risk for all payments on the Notes. ● You are unwilling or unable to consent to the exercise of any U.K. Bail-in Power by any relevant U.K. resolution authority. You must rely on your own evaluation of the merits of an investment in the Notes. You should reach a decision whether to invest in the Notes after carefully considering, with your advisors, the suitability of the Notes in light of your investment objectives and the specific information set out in this pricing supplement and the documents referenced under “Additional Documents Related to the Offering of the Notes” in this pricing supplement. Neither the Issuer nor Barclays Capital Inc. makes any recommendation as to the suitability of the Notes for investment. PS—7 ADDITIONAL TERMS OF THE NOTES The Observation Dates (including the Final Valuation Date), the Contingent Coupon Payment Dates, any Call Settlement Date and the Maturity Date are subject to postponement in certain circumstances, as described under “Reference Assets—Indices—Market Disruption Events for Securities with an Index of Equity Securities as a Reference Asset,” “Reference Assets—Exchange-Traded Funds—Market Disruption Events for Securities with an Exchange-Traded Fund that Holds Equity Securities as a Reference Asset,” “Reference Assets—Least or Best Performing Reference Asset—Scheduled Trading Days and Market Disruption Events for Securities Linked to the Reference Asset with the Lowest or Highest Return in a Group of Two or More Equity Securities, Exchange-Traded Funds and/or Indices of Equity Securities” and “Terms of the Notes—Payment Dates” in the accompanying prospectus supplement. In addition, the Reference Assets and the Notes are subject to adjustment by the Calculation Agent under certain circumstances, as described under “Reference Assets—Indices—Adjustments Relating to Securities with an Index as a Reference Asset” and “Reference Assets—Exchange-Traded Funds—Adjustments Relating to Securities with an Exchange-Traded Fund as a Reference Asset” in the accompanying prospectus supplement. PS—8 HYPOTHETICAL EXAMPLES OF AMOUNTS PAYABLE ON A SINGLE CONTINGENT COUPON PAYMENT DATE The following examples demonstrate the circumstances under which you may receive a Contingent Coupon on a hypothetical Contingent Coupon Payment Date. The numbers appearing in these tables are purely hypothetical and are provided for illustrative purposes only. These examples do not take into account any tax consequences from investing in the Notes and make the following key assumptions: ■ Hypothetical Initial Value of each Reference Asset: 100.00* ■ Hypothetical Coupon Barrier Value for each Reference Asset: 70.00 (70.00% of the hypothetical Initial Value set forth above)* ■ Hypothetical Call Value for each Reference Asset: 100.00 (100.00% of the hypothetical Initial Value set forth above)* * The hypothetical Initial Value of 100.00, the hypothetical Coupon Barrier Value of 70.00 and the hypothetical Call Value of 100.00 for each Reference Asset have been chosen for illustrative purposes only and do not represent a likely Initial Value, Coupon Barrier Value or Call Value for any Reference Asset. The actual Initial Value for each Reference Asset will be equal to its Closing Value on the Initial Valuation Date and the actual Coupon Barrier Value and Call Value for each Reference Asset will be equal to 70.00% and 100.00%, respectively, of its Initial Value. Example 1: The Closing Value of each Reference Asset is greater than its Coupon Barrier Value on the relevant Observation Date. Reference Asset Closing Value on Relevant Observation Date NDX Index 99.00 IWN Fund $75.00 RTY Index 80.00 Because the Closing Value of each Reference Asset is greater than its respective Coupon Barrier Value, you will receive a Contingent Coupon of $9.792 (0.9792% of the principal amount per Note) on the related Contingent Coupon Payment Date. Example 2: The Closing Value of one Reference Asset is greater than its Coupon Barrier Value on the relevant Observation Date and the Closing Value of at least one Reference Asset is less than its Coupon Barrier Value on the relevant Observation Date. Reference Asset Closing Value on Relevant Observation Date NDX Index 80.00 IWN Fund $69.00 RTY Index 50.00 Because the Closing Value of at least one Reference Asset is less than its Coupon Barrier Value, you will not receive a Contingent Coupon on the related Contingent Coupon Payment Date. Example 3: The Closing Value of each Reference Asset is less than its Coupon Barrier Value on the relevant Observation Date. Reference Asset Closing Value on Relevant Observation Date NDX Index 68.00 IWN Fund $50.00 RTY Index 45.00 Because the Closing Value of at least one Reference Asset is less than its Coupon Barrier Value, you will not receive a Contingent Coupon on the related Contingent Coupon Payment Date. Examples 2 and 3 demonstrate that you may not receive a Contingent Coupon on a Contingent Coupon Payment Date. If the Closing Value of any Reference Asset is below its Coupon Barrier Value on each Observation Date, you will not receive any Contingent Coupons during the term of the Notes. In each of the examples above, because the Closing Value of at least one Reference Asset is below its Call Value on the relevant Call Valuation Date, the Notes will not be redeemed on such date. The Notes will be redeemed only if the Closing Value of each Reference Asset on any Call Valuation Date is greater than or equal to its respective Call Value. PS—9 HYPOTHETICAL EXAMPLES OF AMOUNTS PAYABLE UPON AUTOMATIC CALL The following examples demonstrate the hypothetical total return upon an Automatic Call under various circumstances. The “total return” as used in these examples is the number, expressed as a percentage, that results from comparing the aggregate payments per $1,000 principal amount Note to $1,000. The hypothetical total returns set forth below are for illustrative purposes only and may not be the actual total returns applicable to a purchaser of the Notes. The numbers appearing in the following tables and examples have been rounded for ease of analysis. The hypothetical examples below do not take into account any tax consequences from investing in the Notes and make the following key assumption: ■ For each Observation Date that is not also a Call Valuation Date, the Closing Value of at least one Reference Asset is less than its Coupon Barrier Value. Accordingly, you will NOT receive Contingent Coupons on those Observation Dates, unless indicated otherwise below. Example 1: The Notes are redeemed on the first Call Valuation Date. Call Valuation Date Is the Closing Value of any Reference Asset Less Than its Coupon Barrier Value? Is the Closing Value of any Reference Asset Less Than its Call Value? Payment on Contingent Coupon Payment Date (per $1,000 principal amount Note) 1 No No $1,009.792 Because the Closing Value of each Reference Asset on the first Call Valuation Date is greater than or equal to its Call Value, the Notes are redeemed and you will receive the Redemption Price on the related Call Settlement Date. The Notes will cease to be outstanding after the Call Settlement Date, and you will not receive any further payments on the Notes. The total return on investment of the Notes is 0.9792%. Example 2: The Notes are redeemed on the third Call Valuation Date. Call Valuation Date Is the Closing Value of any Reference Asset Less Than its Coupon Barrier Value? Is the Closing Value of any Reference Asset Less Than its Call Value? Payment on Contingent Coupon Payment Date (per $1,000 principal amount Note) 1 No Yes $9.792 2 Yes Yes $0.00 3 No No $1,009.792 Because the Closing Value of each Reference Asset on the third Call Valuation Date is greater than or equal to its Call Value, the Notes are redeemed and you will receive the Redemption Price on the related Call Settlement Date. The Notes will cease to be outstanding after the Call Settlement Date, and you will not receive any further payments on the Notes. The total return on investment of the Notes is 1.9584%. Example 3: The Notes are redeemed on the final Call Valuation Date. Call Valuation Date Is the Closing Value of any Reference Asset Less Than its Coupon Barrier Value? Is the Closing Value of any Reference Asset Less Than its Call Value? Payment on Contingent Coupon Payment Date (per $1,000 principal amount Note) 1 Yes Yes $0.00 2 - 20 With respect to each Call Valuation Date, Yes With respect to each Call Valuation Date, Yes $0.00 21 No No $1,009.792 Because the Closing Value of each Reference Asset on the final Call Valuation Date is greater than or equal to its Call Value, the Notes are redeemed and you will receive the Redemption Price on the related Call Settlement Date. Example 3 demonstrates that the Closing Value of at least one Reference Asset is less than its Coupon Barrier Value on each Observation Date prior to the final Call Valuation Date. Accordingly, no Contingent Coupons are payable on the Notes until the final Call Valuation Date. The Notes will cease to be outstanding after the Call Settlement Date, and you will not receive any further payments on the Notes. The total return on investment of the Notes is 0.9792%. Each of the examples above demonstrate that the return on the Notes upon an Automatic Call will be limited to the Contingent Coupons, if any, that may be payable on the Notes up to and including the applicable Call Settlement Date. PS—10 Each of the examples above demonstrate that a Contingent Coupon will be payable on a Contingent Coupon Payment Date only if the Closing Value of each Reference Asset is greater than or equal to its respective Coupon Barrier Value on an Observation Date. If the Closing Value of any Reference Asset on an Observation Date is less than its Coupon Barrier Value, you will not receive a Contingent Coupon on the related Contingent Coupon Payment Date. If the Closing Value of any Reference Asset is less than its Coupon Barrier Value on each Observation Date, you will not receive any Contingent Coupons during the term of the Notes. PS—11 HYPOTHETICAL EXAMPLES OF AMOUNTS PAYABLE AT MATURITY The following table illustrates the hypothetical payment at maturity under various circumstances. The examples set forth below are purely hypothetical and are provided for illustrative purposes only. The numbers appearing in the following table and examples have been rounded for ease of analysis. The hypothetical examples below do not take into account any tax consequences from investing in the Notes and make the following key assumptions: ■ Hypothetical Initial Value of each Reference Asset: 100.00* ■ Hypothetical Coupon Barrier Value for each Reference Asset: 70.00 (70.00% of the hypothetical Initial Value set forth above)* ■ Hypothetical Barrier Value for each Reference Asset: 70.00 (70.00% of the hypothetical Initial Value set forth above)* ■ You hold the Notes to maturity, and the Notes are NOT redeemed prior to scheduled maturity. * The hypothetical Initial Value of 100.00, the hypothetical Coupon Barrier Value of 70.00 and the hypothetical Barrier Value of 70.00 for each Reference Asset have been chosen for illustrative purposes only and do not represent a likely Initial Value, Coupon Barrier Value or Barrier Value for any Reference Asset. The actual Initial Value for each Reference Asset will be equal to its Closing Value on the Initial Valuation Date, and the actual Coupon Barrier Value and Barrier Value for each Reference Asset will each be equal to 70.00% of its Initial Value. For information regarding recent values of the Reference Assets, please see “Information Regarding the Reference Assets” in this pricing supplement.

The following examples illustrate how the payments at maturity set forth in the table above are calculated: Example 1: The Final Value of Reference Asset A is 135.00, the Final Value of Reference Asset B is $130.00 and the Final Value of Reference Asset C is 140.00. Because Reference Asset B has the lowest Reference Asset Return, Reference Asset B is the Least Performing Reference Asset. Because the Final Value of the Least Performing Reference Asset is greater than or equal to its Barrier Value, you will receive a payment at maturity of $1,000 per $1,000 principal amount Note that you hold (plus the Contingent Coupon that will otherwise be payable on the Maturity Date). PS—12 Example 2: The Final Value of Reference Asset A is 140.00, the Final Value of Reference Asset B is $90.00 and the Final Value of Reference Asset C is 105.00. Because Reference Asset B has the lowest Reference Asset Return, Reference Asset B is the Least Performing Reference Asset. Because the Final Value of the Least Performing Reference Asset is greater than or equal to its Barrier Value, you will receive a payment at maturity of $1,000 per $1,000 principal amount Note that you hold (plus the Contingent Coupon that will otherwise be payable on the Maturity Date). Example 3: The Final Value of Reference Asset A is 60.00, the Final Value of Reference Asset B is $120.00 and the Final Value of Reference Asset C is 100.00. Because Reference Asset A has the lowest Reference Asset Return, Reference Asset A is the Least Performing Reference Asset. Because the Final Value of the Least Performing Reference Asset is less than its Barrier Value, you will receive a payment at maturity of $600.00 per $1,000 principal amount Note that you hold, calculated as follows: $1,000 + [$1,000 × Reference Asset Return of the Least Performing Reference Asset] $1,000 + [$1,000 × -40.00%] = $600.00 In addition, because the Final Value of at least one Reference Asset is less than its Coupon Barrier Value, you will not receive a Contingent Coupon on the Maturity Date. Example 3 demonstrates that if the Notes are not redeemed prior to scheduled maturity, and if the Final Value of the Least Performing Reference Asset is less than its Barrier Value, your investment in the Notes will be fully exposed to the decline of the Least Performing Reference Asset from its Initial Value. You will not benefit in any way from the Reference Asset Return of any other Reference Asset being higher than the Reference Asset Return of the Least Performing Reference Asset. If the Notes are not redeemed prior to scheduled maturity, you may lose up to 100.00% of the principal amount of your Notes. Any payment on the Notes, including the repayment of principal, is subject to the credit risk of Barclays Bank PLC. PS—13 SELECTED RISK CONSIDERATIONS An investment in the Notes involves significant risks. Investing in the Notes is not equivalent to investing directly in the Reference Assets or their components, if any. Some of the risks that apply to an investment in the Notes are summarized below, but we urge you to read the more detailed explanation of risks relating to the Notes generally in the “Risk Factors” section of the prospectus supplement. You should not purchase the Notes unless you understand and can bear the risks of investing in the Notes. Risks Relating to the Notes Generally ● Your Investment in the Notes May Result in a Significant Loss — The Notes differ from ordinary debt securities in that the Issuer will not necessarily repay the full principal amount of the Notes at maturity. If the Notes are not redeemed prior to scheduled maturity, and if the Final Value of the Least Performing Reference Asset is less than its Barrier Value, your Notes will be fully exposed to the decline of the Least Performing Reference Asset from its Initial Value. You may lose up to 100.00% of the principal amount of your Notes. ● Potential Return is Limited to the Contingent Coupons, If Any, and You Will Not Participate in Any Appreciation of Any Reference Asset — The potential positive return on the Notes is limited to the Contingent Coupons, if any, that may be payable during the term of the Notes. You will not participate in any appreciation in the value of any Reference Asset, which may be significant, even though you will be exposed to the depreciation in the value of the Least Performing Reference Asset if the Notes are not redeemed and the Final Value of the Least Performing Reference Asset is less than its Barrier Value. ● You May Not Receive Any Contingent Coupon Payments on the Notes — The Issuer will not necessarily make periodic coupon payments on the Notes. You will receive a Contingent Coupon on a Contingent Coupon Payment Date only if the Closing Value of each Reference Asset on the related Observation Date is greater than or equal to its respective Coupon Barrier Value. If the Closing Value of any Reference Asset on an Observation Date is less than its Coupon Barrier Value, you will not receive a Contingent Coupon on the related Contingent Coupon Payment Date. If the Closing Value of at least one Reference Asset is less than its respective Coupon Barrier Value on each Observation Date, you will not receive any Contingent Coupons during the term of the Notes. ● Because the Notes Are Linked to the Least Performing Reference Asset, You Are Exposed to Greater Risks of No Contingent Coupons and Sustaining a Significant Loss of Principal at Maturity Than If the Notes Were Linked to a Single Reference Asset — The risk that you will not receive any Contingent Coupons and lose a significant portion or all of your principal amount in the Notes at maturity is greater if you invest in the Notes as opposed to substantially similar securities that are linked to the performance of a single Reference Asset. With multiple Reference Assets, it is more likely that the Closing Value of at least one Reference Asset will be less than its Coupon Barrier Value on the specified Observation Dates or less than its Barrier Value on the Final Valuation Date, and therefore, it is more likely that you will not receive any Contingent Coupons and that you will suffer a significant loss of principal at maturity. Further, the performance of the Reference Assets may not be correlated or may be negatively correlated. The lower the correlation between multiple Reference Assets, the greater the potential for one of those Reference Assets to close below its Coupon Barrier Value or Barrier Value on an Observation Date or the Final Valuation Date, respectively. It is impossible to predict what the correlation among the Reference Assets will be over the term of the Notes. The Reference Assets represent different equity markets. These different equity markets may not perform similarly over the term of the Notes. Although the correlation of the Reference Assets’ performance may change over the term of the Notes, the Contingent Coupon rate is determined, in part, based on the correlation of the Reference Assets’ performance calculated using our internal models at the time when the terms of the Notes are finalized. A higher Contingent Coupon is generally associated with lower correlation of the Reference Assets, which reflects a greater potential for missed Contingent Coupons and for a loss of principal at maturity. ● You Are Exposed to the Market Risk of Each Reference Asset — Your return on the Notes is not linked to a basket consisting of the Reference Assets. Rather, it will be contingent upon the independent performance of each Reference Asset. Unlike an instrument with a return linked to a basket of underlying assets in which risk is mitigated and diversified among all the components of the basket, you will be exposed to the risks related to each Reference Asset. Poor performance by any Reference Asset over the term of the Notes may negatively affect your return and will not be offset or mitigated by any increases or lesser declines in the value of any other Reference Asset. To receive a Contingent Coupon, the Closing Value of each Reference Asset must be greater than or equal to its Coupon Barrier Value on the applicable Observation Date. In addition, if the Notes have not been redeemed prior to scheduled maturity, and if the Final Value of any Reference Asset is less than its Barrier Value, you will be exposed to the full decline in the Least Performing Reference Asset from its Initial Value. Accordingly, your investment is subject to the market risk of each Reference Asset. ● The Notes Are Subject to Volatility Risk — Volatility is a measure of the degree of variation in the price of an asset (or level of an index) over a period of time. The amount of any coupon payments that may be payable under the Notes is based on a number of factors, including the expected volatility of the Reference Assets. The amount of such coupon payments will be paid at a per annum rate that is higher than the fixed rate that we would pay on a conventional debt security of the same tenor and is higher than it otherwise would have been had the expected volatility of the Reference Assets been lower. As volatility of a Reference Asset increases, there will typically be a greater likelihood that (a) the Closing Value of that Reference Asset on one or more Observation Dates will be less than its Coupon Barrier Value and (b) the Final Value of that Reference Asset will be less than its Barrier Value. PS—14 Accordingly, you should understand that a higher coupon payment amount reflects, among other things, an indication of a greater likelihood that you will (a) not receive coupon payments with respect to one or more Observation Dates and/or (b) incur a loss of principal at maturity than would have been the case had the amount of such coupon payments been lower. In addition, actual volatility over the term of the Notes may be significantly higher than the expected volatility at the time the terms of the Notes were determined. If actual volatility is higher than expected, you will face an even greater risk that you will not receive coupon payments and/or that you will lose some or all of your principal at maturity for the reasons described above. ● Early Redemption and Reinvestment Risk — While the original term of the Notes is as indicated on the cover of this pricing supplement, the Notes may be redeemed prior to maturity, as described above, and the holding period over which you may receive any coupon payments that may be payable under the Notes could be as short as approximately three months. The Redemption Price that you would receive on a Call Settlement Date, together with any coupon payments that you may have received prior to the Call Settlement Date, may be less than the aggregate amount of payments that you would have received had the Notes not been redeemed. There is no guarantee that you would be able to reinvest the proceeds from an investment in the Notes in a comparable investment with a similar level of risk in the event the Notes are redeemed prior to the Maturity Date. No additional payments will be due after the relevant Call Settlement Date. The fact that the Notes may be redeemed prior to maturity may also adversely impact your ability to sell your Notes and the price at which they may be sold. ● Any Payment on the Notes Will Be Determined Based on the Closing Values of the Reference Assets on the Dates Specified — Any payment on the Notes will be determined based on the Closing Values of the Reference Assets on the dates specified. You will not benefit from any more favorable values of the Reference Assets determined at any other time. ● Contingent Repayment of Any Principal Amount Applies Only at Maturity or upon Any Redemption — You should be willing to hold your Notes to maturity or any redemption. Although the Notes provide for the contingent repayment of the principal amount of your Notes at maturity, provided that the Final Value of the Least Performing Reference Asset is greater than or equal to its Barrier Value, or upon any redemption, if you sell your Notes prior to such time in the secondary market, if any, you may have to sell your Notes at a price that is less than the principal amount even if at that time the value of each Reference Asset has increased from its Initial Value. See “Many Economic and Market Factors Will Impact the Value of the Notes” below. ● Owning the Notes is Not the Same as Owning Any Reference Asset or Any Securities to which Any Reference Asset Provides Exposure — The return on the Notes may not reflect the return you would realize if you actually owned any Reference Asset or any securities to which any Reference Asset provides exposure. As a holder of the Notes, you will not have voting rights or rights to receive dividends or other distributions or any other rights that holders of any Reference Asset or any securities to which any Reference Asset provides exposure may have. ● Tax Treatment — Significant aspects of the tax treatment of the Notes are uncertain. You should consult your tax advisor about your tax situation. See “Tax Considerations” below. Risks Relating to the Issuer ● Credit of Issuer — The Notes are unsecured and unsubordinated debt obligations of the Issuer, Barclays Bank PLC, and are not, either directly or indirectly, an obligation of any third party. Any payment to be made on the Notes, including any repayment of principal, is subject to the ability of Barclays Bank PLC to satisfy its obligations as they come due and is not guaranteed by any third party. As a result, the actual and perceived creditworthiness of Barclays Bank PLC may affect the market value of the Notes, and in the event Barclays Bank PLC were to default on its obligations, you may not receive any amounts owed to you under the terms of the Notes. ● You May Lose Some or All of Your Investment If Any U.K. Bail-in Power Is Exercised by the Relevant U.K. Resolution Authority — Notwithstanding and to the exclusion of any other term of the Notes or any other agreements, arrangements or understandings between Barclays Bank PLC and any holder or beneficial owner of the Notes (or the Trustee on behalf of the holders of the Notes), by acquiring the Notes, each holder and beneficial owner of the Notes acknowledges, accepts, agrees to be bound by, and consents to the exercise of, any U.K. Bail-in Power by the relevant U.K. resolution authority as set forth under “Consent to U.K. Bail-in Power” in this pricing supplement. Accordingly, any U.K. Bail-in Power may be exercised in such a manner as to result in you and other holders and beneficial owners of the Notes losing all or a part of the value of your investment in the Notes or receiving a different security from the Notes, which may be worth significantly less than the Notes and which may have significantly fewer protections than those typically afforded to debt securities. Moreover, the relevant U.K. resolution authority may exercise the U.K. Bail-in Power without providing any advance notice to, or requiring the consent of, the holders and beneficial owners of the Notes. The exercise of any U.K. Bail-in Power by the relevant U.K. resolution authority with respect to the Notes will not be a default or an Event of Default (as each term is defined in the senior debt securities indenture) and the trustee will not be liable for any action that the trustee takes, or abstains from taking, in either case, in accordance with the exercise of the U.K. Bail-in Power by the relevant U.K. resolution authority with respect to the Notes. See “Consent to U.K. Bail-in Power” in this pricing supplement as well as “U.K. Bail-in Power,” “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to the Securities Generally—Regulatory action in the event a bank or investment firm in the Group is failing or likely to fail, including the exercise by the relevant U.K. resolution authority of a variety of statutory resolution powers, could materially adversely affect the value of any securities” and “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to the Securities Generally—Under the terms of the securities, you have agreed to be bound by the exercise of any U.K. Bail-in Power by the relevant U.K. resolution authority” in the accompanying prospectus supplement. PS—15 Risks Relating to the Reference Assets ● Historical Performance of the Reference Assets Should Not Be Taken as Any Indication of the Future Performance of the Reference Assets Over the Term of the Notes — The value of each Reference Asset has fluctuated in the past and may, in the future, experience significant fluctuations. The historical performance of a Reference Asset is not an indication of the future performance of that Reference Asset over the term of the Notes. The historical correlation among the Reference Assets is not an indication of the future correlation among them over the term of the Notes. Therefore, the performance of the Reference Assets individually or in comparison to each other over the term of the Notes may bear no relation or resemblance to the historical performance of any Reference Asset. ● Each Index Reflects the Price Return of the Securities Composing that Index, Not the Total Return — The return on the Notes is based on the performance of the Indices, which reflects changes in the market prices of the securities composing that Index. The Indices are not \"total return\" indices that, in addition to reflecting those price returns, would also reflect dividends paid on the securities composing that Index. Accordingly, the return on the Notes will not include such a total return feature. ● Adjustments to Any Index Could Adversely Affect the Value of the Notes — The sponsor of any Index may add, delete, substitute or adjust the securities composing that Index or make other methodological changes to that Index that could affect its value. The Calculation Agent will calculate the value to be used as the Closing Value of that Index in the event of certain material changes in or modifications to that Index. In addition, the sponsor of any Index may also discontinue or suspend calculation or publication of that Index at any time. Under these circumstances, the Calculation Agent may select a successor index that the Calculation Agent determines to be comparable to that Index or, if no successor index is available, the Calculation Agent will determine the value to be used as the Closing Value of that Index. Any of these actions could adversely affect the value of any Index and, consequently, the value of the Notes. See “Reference Assets—Indices—Adjustments Relating to Securities with an Index as a Reference Asset” in the accompanying prospectus supplement. ● The Notes Are Subject to Risks Associated with Non-U.S. Securities Markets — Certain component securities of the NDX Index are issued by non-U.S. companies in non-U.S. securities markets. Investments in securities linked to the value of such non-U.S. equity securities, such as the Notes, involve risks associated with the securities markets in the home countries of the issuers of those non-U.S. equity securities, including risks of volatility in those markets, governmental intervention in those markets and cross shareholdings in companies in certain countries. Also, there is generally less publicly available information about companies in some of these jurisdictions than there is about U.S. companies that are subject to the reporting requirements of the SEC, and generally non-U.S. companies are subject to accounting, auditing and financial reporting standards and requirements and securities trading rules different from those applicable to U.S. reporting companies. The prices of securities in non-U.S. markets may be affected by political, economic, financial and social factors in those countries, or global regions, including changes in government, economic and fiscal policies and currency exchange laws. ● The Notes Are Subject to Small-Capitalization Companies Risk with Respect to the RTY Index and the IWN Fund — The RTY Index tracks companies that are considered small-capitalization companies and the IWN Fund holds component securities that are issued by companies that are considered small-capitalization companies. These companies often have greater stock price volatility, lower trading volume and less liquidity than large-capitalization companies, and therefore Notes linked to the RTY Index or the IWN Fund may be more volatile than an investment linked to an index with component stocks issued by large-capitalization companies. Stock prices of small-capitalization companies are also more vulnerable than those of large-capitalization companies to adverse business and economic developments. In addition, small-capitalization companies are typically less stable financially than large-capitalization companies and may depend on a small number of key personnel, making them more vulnerable to loss of personnel. Small-capitalization companies are often subject to less analyst coverage and may be in early, and less predictable, periods of their corporate existences. Such companies tend to have smaller revenues, less diverse product lines, smaller shares of their product or service markets, fewer financial resources and less competitive strengths than large-capitalization companies and are more susceptible to adverse developments related to their products. ● Certain Features of Exchange-Traded Funds Will Impact the Value of the Notes — The performance of the IWN Fund will not fully replicate the performance of its Underlying Index (as defined below), and the IWN Fund may hold securities not included in its Underlying Index. The value of the IWN Fund is subject to: ■ Management Risk. This is the risk that the investment strategy for the IWN Fund, the implementation of which is subject to a number of constraints, may not produce the intended results. However, the IWN Fund is not actively managed and the investment advisor of the IWN Fund will generally not attempt to take defensive positions in declining markets. ■ Derivatives Risk. The IWN Fund may invest in derivatives, including forward contracts, futures contracts, options on futures contracts, options and swaps. A derivative is a financial contract, the value of which depends on, or is derived from, the value of an underlying asset such as a security or an index. Compared to conventional securities, derivatives can be more sensitive to changes in interest rates or to sudden fluctuations in market prices, and thus the IWN Fund’s losses, and, as a consequence, the losses on your Notes, may be greater than if the IWN Fund invested only in conventional securities. ■ Transaction costs and fees. Unlike its Underlying Index, the IWN Fund will reflect transaction costs and fees that will reduce its performance relative to its Underlying Index. Generally, the longer the time remaining to maturity, the more the market price of the Notes will be affected by the factors described above. In addition, the IWN Fund may diverge significantly from the performance of its Underlying Index due to differences in trading hours between the IWN Fund and the securities composing its Underlying Index or other circumstances. PS—16 During periods of market volatility, the component securities held by the IWN Fund may be unavailable in the secondary market, market participants may be unable to calculate accurately the intraday net asset value per share of the IWN Fund and the liquidity of the IWN Fund may be adversely affected. This kind of market volatility may also disrupt the ability of market participants to create and redeem shares in the IWN Fund. Further, market volatility may adversely affect, sometimes materially, the prices at which market participants are willing to buy and sell shares of the IWN Fund. As a result, under these circumstances, the market value of the IWN Fund may vary substantially from the net asset value per share of the IWN Fund. Because the Notes are linked to the performance of the IWN Fund and not its Underlying Index, the return on your Notes may be less than that of an alternative investment linked directly to its Underlying Index. ● Adjustments to the IWN Fund or its Underlying Index Could Adversely Affect the Value of the Notes or Result in the Notes Being Accelerated — The investment adviser of the IWN Fund may add, delete or substitute the component securities held by the IWN Fund or make changes to its investment strategy, and the sponsor of the Underlying Index that the IWN Fund is designed to track may add, delete, substitute or adjust the securities composing its Underlying Index or make other methodological changes to its Underlying Index that could affect its performance. In addition, if the shares of the IWN Fund are delisted or if the IWN Fund is liquidated or otherwise terminated, the Calculation Agent may select a successor fund that the Calculation Agent determines to be comparable to the IWN Fund or, if no successor fund is available, the Maturity Date of the Notes will be accelerated for a payment determined by the Calculation Agent. Any of these actions could adversely affect the value of the IWN Fund and, consequently, the value of the Notes. Any amount payable upon acceleration could be significantly less than the amount(s) that would be due on the securities if they were not accelerated. See “Reference Assets—Exchange-Traded Funds—Adjustments Relating to Securities with an Exchange-Traded Fund as a Reference Asset—Discontinuance of an Exchange-Traded Fund” in the accompanying prospectus supplement. ● Anti-Dilution Protection Is Limited, and the Calculation Agent Has Discretion to Make Anti-Dilution Adjustments — The Calculation Agent may in its sole discretion make adjustments affecting the amounts payable on the Notes upon the occurrence of certain events that the Calculation Agent determines have a diluting or concentrative effect on the theoretical value of the shares of the IWN Fund. However, the Calculation Agent might not make such adjustments in response to all events that could affect the shares of the IWN Fund. The occurrence of any such event and any adjustment made by the Calculation Agent (or a determination by the Calculation Agent not to make any adjustment) may adversely affect any amounts payable on the Notes. See “Reference Assets—Exchange-Traded Funds—Adjustments Relating to Securities with an Exchange-Traded Fund as a Reference Asset—Anti-dilution Adjustments” in the accompanying prospectus supplement. ● The Investment Strategy Represented by the IWN Fund May Not be Successful — The IWN Fund is intended to represent a “value” investment strategy. The IWN Fund seeks to track the investment results, before fees and expenses, of an index composed of small-capitalization U.S. equities that exhibit value characteristics, which is currently the Underlying Index. The Underlying Index measures the capitalization weighted price performance of the stocks included in the Russell 2000® Index that are determined by the sponsor of the Underlying Index to be value oriented, with lower price-to-book ratios and lower forecasted and historical growth. A “value” investment strategy is premised on the goal of investing in stocks that are determined to be relatively cheap or “undervalued” under the assumption that the value of those stocks will increase over time as the market comes to recognize and reflect the “fair” market value of those stocks. However, stocks that are considered value stocks may fail to appreciate for extended periods of time, and may never realize their full potential value. Moreover, the value characteristics referenced by the Underlying Index may not be accurate predictors of undervalued stocks. In addition, the Underlying Index’s selection methodology includes a significant bias against stocks with strong growth characteristics, and stocks with strong growth characteristics may outperform stocks with weak growth characteristics. There is no assurance that the Underlying Index will outperform any other index or strategy that tracks U.S. stocks selected using other criteria and may underperform the Russell 2000® Index as a whole. It is possible that the stock selection methodology of the Underlying Index will adversely affect its return and, consequently, the level of the Underlying Index and the value and return of the Notes. Risks Relating to Conflicts of Interest ● We and Our Affiliates May Engage in Various Activities or Make Determinations That Could Materially Affect the Notes in Various Ways and Create Conflicts of Interest — We and our affiliates play a variety of roles in connection with the issuance of the Notes, as described below. In performing these roles, our and our affiliates’ economic interests are potentially adverse to your interests as an investor in the Notes. In connection with our normal business activities and in connection with hedging our obligations under the Notes, we and our affiliates make markets in and trade various financial instruments or products for our accounts and for the account of our clients and otherwise provide investment banking and other financial services with respect to these financial instruments and products. These financial instruments and products may include securities, derivative instruments or assets that may relate to the Reference Assets or their components, if any. In any such market making, trading and hedging activity, and other financial services, we or our affiliates may take positions or take actions that are inconsistent with, or adverse to, the investment objectives of the holders of the Notes. We and our affiliates have no obligation to take the needs of any buyer, seller or holder of the Notes into account in conducting these activities. Such market making, trading and hedging activity, investment banking and other financial services may negatively impact the value of the Notes. In addition, the role played by Barclays Capital Inc., as the agent for the Notes, could present significant conflicts of interest with the role of Barclays Bank PLC, as issuer of the Notes. For example, Barclays Capital Inc. or its representatives may derive compensation or financial benefit from the distribution of the Notes and such compensation or financial benefit may serve as PS—17 incentive to sell the Notes instead of other investments. Furthermore, we and our affiliates establish the offering price of the Notes for initial sale to the public, and the offering price is not based upon any independent verification or valuation. In addition to the activities described above, we will also act as the Calculation Agent for the Notes. As Calculation Agent, we will determine any values of the Reference Assets and make any other determinations necessary to calculate any payments on the Notes. In making these determinations, the Calculation Agent may be required to make discretionary judgements relating to the Reference Assets, including determining whether a market disruption event has occurred or whether certain adjustments to the Reference Assets or other terms of the Notes are necessary, as further described in the accompanying prospectus supplement. In making these discretionary judgments, our economic interests are potentially adverse to your interests as an investor in the Notes, and any of these determinations may adversely affect any payments on the Notes. Risks Relating to the Estimated Value of the Notes and the Secondary Market ● The Estimated Value of Your Notes is Expected to be Lower Than the Initial Issue Price of Your Notes — The estimated value of your Notes on the Initial Valuation Date is expected to be lower, and may be significantly lower, than the initial issue price of your Notes. The difference between the initial issue price of your Notes and the estimated value of the Notes is a result of certain factors, such as any sales commissions to be paid to Barclays Capital Inc. or another affiliate of ours, any selling concessions, discounts, commissions or fees (including any structuring or other distribution related fees) to be allowed or paid to non-affiliated intermediaries, the estimated profit that we or any of our affiliates expect to earn in connection with structuring the Notes, the estimated cost which we may incur in hedging our obligations under the Notes, and estimated development and other costs which we may incur in connection with the Notes. ● The Estimated Value of Your Notes Might be Lower if Such Estimated Value Were Based on the Levels at Which Our Debt Securities Trade in the Secondary Market — The estimated value of your Notes on the Initial Valuation Date is based on a number of variables, including our internal funding rates. Our internal funding rates may vary from the levels at which our benchmark debt securities trade in the secondary market. As a result of this difference, the estimated value referenced above might be lower if such estimated value were based on the levels at which our benchmark debt securities trade in the secondary market. ● The Estimated Value of the Notes is Based on Our Internal Pricing Models, Which May Prove to be Inaccurate and May be Different from the Pricing Models of Other Financial Institutions — The estimated value of your Notes on the Initial Valuation Date is based on our internal pricing models, which take into account a number of variables and are based on a number of subjective assumptions, which may or may not materialize. These variables and assumptions are not evaluated or verified on an independent basis. Further, our pricing models may be different from other financial institutions’ pricing models and the methodologies used by us to estimate the value of the Notes may not be consistent with those of other financial institutions which may be purchasers or sellers of Notes in the secondary market. As a result, the secondary market price of your Notes may be materially different from the estimated value of the Notes determined by reference to our internal pricing models. ● The Estimated Value of Your Notes Is Not a Prediction of the Prices at Which You May Sell Your Notes in the Secondary Market, if any, and Such Secondary Market Prices, If Any, Will Likely be Lower Than the Initial Issue Price of Your Notes and May be Lower Than the Estimated Value of Your Notes — The estimated value of the Notes will not be a prediction of the prices at which Barclays Capital Inc., other affiliates of ours or third parties may be willing to purchase the Notes from you in secondary market transactions (if they are willing to purchase, which they are not obligated to do). The price at which you may be able to sell your Notes in the secondary market at any time will be influenced by many factors that cannot be predicted, such as market conditions, and any bid and ask spread for similar sized trades, and may be substantially less than our estimated value of the Notes. Further, as secondary market prices of your Notes take into account the levels at which our debt securities trade in the secondary market, and do not take into account our various costs related to the Notes such as fees, commissions, discounts, and the costs of hedging our obligations under the Notes, secondary market prices of your Notes will likely be lower than the initial issue price of your Notes. As a result, the price at which Barclays Capital Inc., other affiliates of ours or third parties may be willing to purchase the Notes from you in secondary market transactions, if any, will likely be lower than the price you paid for your Notes, and any sale prior to the Maturity Date could result in a substantial loss to you. ● The Temporary Price at Which We May Initially Buy The Notes in the Secondary Market And the Value We May Initially Use for Customer Account Statements, If We Provide Any Customer Account Statements At All, May Not Be Indicative of Future Prices of Your Notes — Assuming that all relevant factors remain constant after the Initial Valuation Date, the price at which Barclays Capital Inc. may initially buy or sell the Notes in the secondary market (if Barclays Capital Inc. makes a market in the Notes, which it is not obligated to do) and the value that we may initially use for customer account statements, if we provide any customer account statements at all, may exceed our estimated value of the Notes on the Initial Valuation Date, as well as the secondary market value of the Notes, for a temporary period after the initial Issue Date of the Notes. The price at which Barclays Capital Inc. may initially buy or sell the Notes in the secondary market and the value that we may initially use for customer account statements may not be indicative of future prices of your Notes. ● Lack of Liquidity — The Notes will not be listed on any securities exchange. Barclays Capital Inc. and other affiliates of Barclays Bank PLC intend to make a secondary market for the Notes but are not required to do so, and may discontinue any such secondary market making at any time, without notice. Barclays Capital Inc. may at any time hold unsold inventory, which may inhibit the development of a secondary market for the Notes. Even if there is a secondary market, it may not provide enough liquidity to allow you to trade or sell the Notes easily. Because other dealers are not likely to make a secondary market PS—18 for the Notes, the price at which you may be able to trade your Notes is likely to depend on the price, if any, at which Barclays Capital Inc. and other affiliates of Barclays Bank PLC are willing to buy the Notes. The Notes are not designed to be short-term trading instruments. Accordingly, you should be willing and able to hold your Notes to maturity. ● Many Economic and Market Factors Will Impact the Value of the Notes — The value of the Notes will be affected by a number of economic and market factors that interact in complex and unpredictable ways and that may either offset or magnify each other, including: o the market price of, dividend rate on and expected volatility of the Reference Assets or the components of the Reference Assets, if any; o correlation (or lack of correlation) of the Reference Assets; o the time to maturity of the Notes; o interest and yield rates in the market generally; o a variety of economic, financial, political, regulatory or judicial events; o supply and demand for the Notes; and o our creditworthiness, including actual or anticipated downgrades in our credit ratings.

Historical Performance of the Russell 2000® Index PAST PERFORMANCE IS NOT INDICATIVE OF FUTURE RESULTS PS—22 TAX CONSIDERATIONS You should review carefully the sections in the accompanying prospectus supplement entitled “Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences—Tax Consequences to U.S. Holders—Notes Treated as Prepaid Forward or Derivative Contracts with Associated Contingent Coupons” and, if you are a non-U.S. holder, “—Tax Consequences to Non-U.S. Holders.” The following discussion supersedes the discussion in the accompanying prospectus supplement to the extent it is inconsistent therewith. In determining our reporting responsibilities, if any, we intend to treat (i) the Notes for U.S. federal income tax purposes as prepaid forward contracts with associated contingent coupons and (ii) any Contingent Coupon payments as ordinary income, as described in the section entitled “Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences—Tax Consequences to U.S. Holders—Notes Treated as Prepaid Forward or Derivative Contracts with Associated Contingent Coupons” in the accompanying prospectus supplement. Our special tax counsel, Davis Polk & Wardwell LLP, has advised that it believes this treatment to be reasonable, but that there are other reasonable treatments that the Internal Revenue Service (the “IRS”) or a court may adopt. Sale, exchange or redemption of a Note. Assuming the treatment described above is respected, upon a sale or exchange of the Notes (including redemption upon an automatic call or at maturity), you should recognize capital gain or loss equal to the difference between the amount realized on the sale or exchange and your tax basis in the Notes, which should equal the amount you paid to acquire the Notes (assuming Contingent Coupon payments are properly treated as ordinary income, consistent with the position referred to above). This gain or loss should be short-term capital gain or loss unless you hold the Notes for more than one year, in which case the gain or loss should be long-term capital gain or loss, whether or not you are an initial purchaser of the Notes at the issue price. The deductibility of capital losses is subject to limitations. If you sell your Notes between the time your right to a Contingent Coupon payment is fixed and the time it is paid, it is likely that you will be treated as receiving ordinary income equal to the Contingent Coupon payment. Although uncertain, it is possible that proceeds received from the sale or exchange of your Notes prior to an Observation Date but that can be attributed to an expected Contingent Coupon payment could be treated as ordinary income. You should consult your tax advisor regarding this issue. As noted above, there are other reasonable treatments that the IRS or a court may adopt, in which case the timing and character of any income or loss on the Notes could be materially affected. In addition, in 2007 the U.S. Treasury Department and the IRS released a notice requesting comments on the U.S. federal income tax treatment of “prepaid forward contracts” and similar instruments. The notice focuses in particular on whether to require investors in these instruments to accrue income over the term of their investment. It also asks for comments on a number of related topics, including the character of income or loss with respect to these instruments and the relevance of factors such as the nature of the underlying property to which the instruments are linked. While the notice requests comments on appropriate transition rules and effective dates, any Treasury regulations or other guidance promulgated after consideration of these issues could materially affect the tax consequences of an investment in the Notes, possibly with retroactive effect. You should consult your tax advisor regarding the U.S. federal income tax consequences of an investment in the Notes, including possible alternative treatments and the issues presented by this notice. Non-U.S. holders. Insofar as we have responsibility as a withholding agent, we do not currently intend to treat Contingent Coupon payments to non-U.S. holders (as defined in the accompanying prospectus supplement) as subject to U.S. withholding tax. However, non-U.S. holders should in any event expect to be required to provide appropriate Forms W-8 or other documentation in order to establish an exemption from backup withholding, as described under the heading “—Information Reporting and Backup Withholding” in the accompanying prospectus supplement. If any withholding is required, we will not be required to pay any additional amounts with respect to amounts withheld. Treasury regulations under Section 871(m) generally impose a withholding tax on certain “dividend equivalents” under certain “equity linked instruments.” A recent IRS notice excludes from the scope of Section 871(m) instruments issued prior to January 1, 2025 that do not have a “delta of one” with respect to underlying securities that could pay U.S.-source dividends for U.S. federal income tax purposes (each an “Underlying Security”). Based on our determination that the Notes do not have a “delta of one” within the meaning of the regulations, we expect that these regulations will not apply to the Notes with regard to non-U.S. holders. Our determination is not binding on the IRS, and the IRS may disagree with this determination. Section 871(m) is complex and its application may depend on your particular circumstances, including whether you enter into other transactions with respect to an Underlying Security. If necessary, further information regarding the potential application of Section 871(m) will be provided in the pricing supplement for the Notes. You should consult your tax advisor regarding the potential application of Section 871(m) to the Notes. PS—23 SUPPLEMENTAL PLAN OF DISTRIBUTION We will agree to sell to Barclays Capital Inc. (the “Agent”), and the Agent will agree to purchase from us, the principal amount of the Notes, and at the price, specified on the cover of this pricing supplement.

The estimated value is expected to be less than the initial issue price of the Notes. See “Additional Information Regarding Our Estimated Value of the Notes” on page PS—5 of this pricing supplement. (3) Barclays Capital Inc. will receive commissions from the Issuer of up to $35.00 per $1,000 principal amount Note. Barclays Capital Inc. will use these commissions to pay variable selling concessions or fees (including custodial or clearing fees) to other dealers. The actual commission received by Barclays Capital Inc. will be equal to the selling concession paid to such dealers. Investing in the Notes involves a number of risks.

Terms of the Notes, Continued Automatic Call: The Notes cannot be redeemed for approximately the first six months after the Issue Date. If, on any Call Valuation Date, the Closing Value of each Reference Asset is greater than or equal to its Call Value, the Notes will be automatically redeemed for a cash payment per $1,000 principal amount Note equal to the Redemption Price payable on the Call Settlement Date. No further amounts will be payable on the Notes after the Call Settlement Date. Contingent Coupon: $16.667 per $1,000 principal amount Note, which is 1.6667% of the principal amount per Note (rounded to four decimal places, as applicable) (based on 20.00% per annum rate) If the Closing Value of each Reference Asset on an Observation Date is greater than or equal to its respective Coupon Barrier Value, you will receive a Contingent Coupon on the related Contingent Coupon Payment Date.

Calculation Agent: Barclays Bank PLC CUSIP / ISIN: 06745MMK1 / US06745MMK17 *     Subject to postponement, as described under “Additional Terms of the Notes” in this pricing supplement PS—2 ADDITIONAL DOCUMENTS RELATED TO THE OFFERING OF THE NOTES You should read this pricing supplement together with the prospectus dated May 23, 2022 as supplemented by the documents listed below, relating to our Global Medium-Term Notes, Series A, of which these Notes are a part. This pricing supplement, together with the documents listed below, contains the terms of the Notes and supersedes all prior or contemporaneous oral statements as well as any other written materials including preliminary or indicative pricing terms, correspondence, trade ideas, structures for implementation, sample structures, brochures or other educational materials of ours. You should carefully consider, among other things, the matters set forth under “Risk Factors” in the prospectus supplement and “Selected Risk Considerations” in this pricing supplement, as the Notes involve risks not associated with conventional debt securities. We urge you to consult your investment, legal, tax, accounting and other advisors before you invest in the Notes. You may access these documents on the SEC website at www.sec.gov as follows (or if such address has changed, by reviewing our filings for the relevant date on the SEC website): ● Prospectus dated May 23, 2022: http://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/312070/000119312522157585/d337542df3asr.htm ● Prospectus Supplement dated June 27, 2022: http://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0000312070/000095010322011301/dp169388_424b2-prosupp.htm Our SEC file number is 1—10257.

PS—3 CONSENT TO U.K. BAIL-IN POWER Notwithstanding and to the exclusion of any other term of the Notes or any other agreements, arrangements or understandings between us and any holder or beneficial owner of the Notes (or the Trustee on behalf of the holders of the Notes), by acquiring the Notes, each holder and beneficial owner of the Notes acknowledges, accepts, agrees to be bound by, and consents to the exercise of, any U.K. Bail-in Power by the relevant U.K. resolution authority. Under the U.K. Banking Act 2009, as amended, the relevant U.K. resolution authority may exercise a U.K. Bail-in Power in circumstances in which the relevant U.K. resolution authority is satisfied that the resolution conditions are met. These conditions include that a U.K. bank or investment firm is failing or is likely to fail to satisfy the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 (the “FSMA”) threshold conditions for authorization to carry on certain regulated activities (within the meaning of section 55B FSMA) or, in the case of a U.K. banking group company that is a European Economic Area (“EEA”) or third country institution or investment firm, that the relevant EEA or third country relevant authority is satisfied that the resolution conditions are met in respect of that entity. The U.K. Bail-in Power includes any write-down, conversion, transfer, modification and/or suspension power, which allows for (i) the reduction or cancellation of all, or a portion, of the principal amount of, interest on, or any other amounts payable on, the Notes; (ii) the conversion of all, or a portion, of the principal amount of, interest on, or any other amounts payable on, the Notes into shares or other securities or other obligations of Barclays Bank PLC or another person (and the issue to, or conferral on, the holder or beneficial owner of the Notes such shares, securities or obligations); (iii) the cancellation of the Notes and/or (iv) the amendment or alteration of the maturity of the Notes, or amendment of the amount of interest or any other amounts due on the Notes, or the dates on which interest or any other amounts become payable, including by suspending payment for a temporary period; which U.K. Bail-in Power may be exercised by means of a variation of the terms of the Notes solely to give effect to the exercise by the relevant U.K. resolution authority of such U.K. Bail-in Power. Each holder and beneficial owner of the Notes further acknowledges and agrees that the rights of the holders or beneficial owners of the Notes are subject to, and will be varied, if necessary, solely to give effect to, the exercise of any U.K. Bail-in Power by the relevant U.K. resolution authority. For the avoidance of doubt, this consent and acknowledgment is not a waiver of any rights holders or beneficial owners of the Notes may have at law if and to the extent that any U.K. Bail-in Power is exercised by the relevant U.K. resolution authority in breach of laws applicable in England. For more information, please see “Selected Risk Considerations—Risks Relating to the Issuer—You May Lose Some or All of Your Investment If Any U.K. Bail-in Power Is Exercised by the Relevant U.K. Resolution Authority” in this pricing supplement as well as “U.K. Bail-in Power,” “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to the Securities Generally—Regulatory action in the event a bank or investment firm in the Group is failing or likely to fail, including the exercise by the relevant U.K. resolution authority of a variety of statutory resolution powers, could materially adversely affect the value of any securities” and “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to the Securities Generally—Under the terms of the securities, you have agreed to be bound by the exercise of any U.K. Bail-in Power by the relevant U.K. resolution authority” in the accompanying prospectus supplement. PS—4 ADDITIONAL INFORMATION REGARDING OUR ESTIMATED VALUE OF THE NOTES The range of the estimated values of the Notes referenced above may not correlate on a linear basis with the range of any other term of the Notes as may be set forth in this pricing supplement. We determined the size of such range based on prevailing market conditions, as well as the anticipated duration of the marketing period for the Notes. The final terms for the Notes will be determined on the date the Notes are initially priced for sale to the public, which we refer to as the Initial Valuation Date, based on prevailing market conditions on or prior to the Initial Valuation Date, and will be communicated to investors either orally or in a final pricing supplement. Our internal pricing models take into account a number of variables and are based on a number of subjective assumptions, which may or may not materialize, typically including volatility, interest rates, and our internal funding rates. Our internal funding rates (which are our internally published borrowing rates based on variables such as market benchmarks, our appetite for borrowing, and our existing obligations coming to maturity) may vary from the levels at which our benchmark debt securities trade in the secondary market. Our estimated value on the Initial Valuation Date is based on our internal funding rates. Our estimated value of the Notes may be lower if such valuation were based on the levels at which our benchmark debt securities trade in the secondary market. Our estimated value of the Notes on the Initial Valuation Date is expected to be less than the initial issue price of the Notes. The difference between the initial issue price of the Notes and our estimated value of the Notes is a result of several factors, including any sales commissions to be paid to Barclays Capital Inc. or another affiliate of ours, any selling concessions, discounts, commissions or fees (including any structuring or other distribution related fees) to be allowed or paid to non-affiliated intermediaries, the estimated profit that we or any of our affiliates expect to earn in connection with structuring the Notes, the estimated cost which we may incur in hedging our obligations under the Notes, and estimated development and other costs which we may incur in connection with the Notes. Our estimated value on the Initial Valuation Date is not a prediction of the price at which the Notes may trade in the secondary market, nor will it be the price at which Barclays Capital Inc. may buy or sell the Notes in the secondary market. Subject to normal market and funding conditions, Barclays Capital Inc. or another affiliate of ours intends to offer to purchase the Notes in the secondary market but it is not obligated to do so. Assuming that all relevant factors remain constant after the Initial Valuation Date, the price at which Barclays Capital Inc. may initially buy or sell the Notes in the secondary market, if any, and the value that we may initially use for customer account statements, if we provide any customer account statements at all, may exceed our estimated value on the Initial Valuation Date for a temporary period expected to be approximately six months after the Issue Date because, in our discretion, we may elect to effectively reimburse to investors a portion of the estimated cost of hedging our obligations under the Notes and other costs in connection with the Notes which we will no longer expect to incur over the term of the Notes. We made such discretionary election and determined this temporary reimbursement period on the basis of a number of factors, which may include the tenor of the Notes and/or any agreement we may have with the distributors of the Notes. The amount of our estimated costs which we effectively reimburse to investors in this way may not be allocated ratably throughout the reimbursement period, and we may discontinue such reimbursement at any time or revise the duration of the reimbursement period after the initial Issue Date of the Notes based on changes in market conditions and other factors that cannot be predicted. We urge you to read the “Selected Risk Considerations” beginning on page PS-14 of this pricing supplement. You may revoke your offer to purchase the Notes at any time prior to the Initial Valuation Date. We reserve the right to change the terms of, or reject any offer to purchase, the Notes prior to the Initial Valuation Date. In the event of any changes to the terms of the Notes, we will notify you and you will be asked to accept such changes in connection with your purchase. You may also choose to reject such changes in which case we may reject your offer to purchase. PS—5 SELECTED PURCHASE CONSIDERATIONS The Notes are not suitable for all investors. The Notes may be a suitable investment for you if all of the following statements are true: ● You do not seek an investment that produces fixed periodic interest or coupon payments or other non-contingent sources of current income, and you can tolerate receiving few or no Contingent Coupons over the term of the Notes in the event the Closing Value of any Reference Asset falls below its Coupon Barrier Value on one or more of the specified Observation Dates. ● You understand and accept that you will not participate in any appreciation of any Reference Asset, which may be significant, and that your return potential on the Notes is limited to the Contingent Coupons, if any, paid on the Notes. ● You can tolerate a loss of a significant portion or all of the principal amount of your Notes, and you are willing and able to make an investment that may have the full downside market risk of an investment in the Least Performing Reference Asset. ● You do not anticipate that the Closing Value of any Reference Asset will fall below its Coupon Barrier Value on any Observation Date or below its Barrier Value on the Final Valuation Date. ● You understand and accept that you will not be entitled to receive dividends or distributions that may be paid to holders of any Reference Asset or any securities to which any Reference Asset provides exposure, nor will you have any voting rights with respect to any Reference Asset or any securities to which any Reference Asset provides exposure. ● You are willing and able to accept the individual market risk of each Reference Asset and understand that any decline in the value of one Reference Asset will not be offset or mitigated by a lesser decline or any potential increase in the value of any other Reference Asset. ● You understand and accept the risks that (a) you will not receive a Contingent Coupon if the Closing Value of any Reference Asset is less than its Coupon Barrier Value on an Observation Date and (b) you will lose some or all of your principal at maturity if the Final Value of any Reference Asset is less than its Barrier Value. ● You understand and accept the risk that, if the Notes are not redeemed prior to scheduled maturity, the payment at maturity, if any, will be based solely on the Reference Asset Return of the Least Performing Reference Asset. ● You understand and are willing and able to accept the risks associated with an investment linked to the performance of the Reference Assets. ● You are willing and able to accept the risk that the Notes may be redeemed prior to scheduled maturity and that you may not be able to reinvest your money in an alternative investment with comparable risk and yield. ● You can tolerate fluctuations in the price of the Notes prior to scheduled maturity that may be similar to or exceed the downside fluctuations in the values of the Reference Assets. ● You do not seek an investment for which there will be an active secondary market, and you are willing and able to hold the Notes to maturity if the Notes are not redeemed. ● You are willing and able to assume our credit risk for all payments on the Notes. ● You are willing and able to consent to the exercise of any U.K. Bail-in Power by any relevant U.K. resolution authority. The Notes may not be a suitable investment for you if any of the following statements are true: ● You seek an investment that produces fixed periodic interest or coupon payments or other non-contingent sources of current income, and/or you cannot tolerate receiving few or no Contingent Coupons over the term of the Notes in the event the Closing Value of any Reference Asset falls below its Coupon Barrier Value on one or more of the specified Observation Dates. ● You seek an investment that participates in the full appreciation of any or all of the Reference Assets rather than an investment with a return that is limited to the Contingent Coupons, if any, paid on the Notes. ● You seek an investment that provides for the full repayment of principal at maturity, and/or you are unwilling or unable to accept the risk that you may lose some or all of the principal amount of the Notes in the event that the Final Value of the Least Performing Reference Asset falls below its Barrier Value. ● You anticipate that the Closing Value of at least one Reference Asset will decline during the term of the Notes such that the Closing Value of at least one Reference Asset will fall below its Coupon Barrier Value on one or more Observation Dates and/or the Final Value of at least one Reference Asset will fall below its Barrier Value. ● You are unwilling or unable to accept the individual market risk of each Reference Asset and/or do not understand that any decline in the value of one Reference Asset will not be offset or mitigated by a lesser decline or any potential increase in the value of any other Reference Asset. ● You do not understand and/or are unwilling or unable to accept the risks associated with an investment linked to the performance of the Reference Assets. ● You are unwilling or unable to accept the risk that the negative performance of only one Reference Asset may cause you to not receive Contingent Coupons and/or suffer a loss of principal at maturity, regardless of the performance of any other Reference Asset. ● You are unwilling or unable to accept the risk that the Notes may be redeemed prior to scheduled maturity. ● You seek an investment that entitles you to dividends or distributions on, or voting rights related to any Reference Asset or any securities to which any Reference Asset provides exposure. PS—6 ● You cannot tolerate fluctuations in the price of the Notes prior to scheduled maturity that may be similar to or exceed the downside fluctuations in the values of the Reference Assets. ● You seek an investment for which there will be an active secondary market, and/or you are unwilling or unable to hold the Notes to maturity if the Notes are not redeemed. ● You prefer the lower risk, and therefore accept the potentially lower returns, of fixed income investments with comparable maturities and credit ratings. ● You are unwilling or unable to assume our credit risk for all payments on the Notes. ● You are unwilling or unable to consent to the exercise of any U.K. Bail-in Power by any relevant U.K. resolution authority. You must rely on your own evaluation of the merits of an investment in the Notes. You should reach a decision whether to invest in the Notes after carefully considering, with your advisors, the suitability of the Notes in light of your investment objectives and the specific information set out in this pricing supplement and the documents referenced under “Additional Documents Related to the Offering of the Notes” in this pricing supplement. Neither the Issuer nor Barclays Capital Inc. makes any recommendation as to the suitability of the Notes for investment. PS—7 ADDITIONAL TERMS OF THE NOTES The Observation Dates (including the Final Valuation Date), the Contingent Coupon Payment Dates, any Call Settlement Date and the Maturity Date are subject to postponement in certain circumstances, as described under “Reference Assets—Equity Securities—Market Disruption Events for Securities with an Equity Security as a Reference Asset,” “Reference Assets—Least or Best Performing Reference Asset—Scheduled Trading Days and Market Disruption Events for Securities Linked to the Reference Asset with the Lowest or Highest Return in a Group of Two or More Equity Securities, Exchange-Traded Funds and/or Indices of Equity Securities” and “Terms of the Notes—Payment Dates” in the accompanying prospectus supplement. In addition, the Reference Assets and the Notes are subject to adjustment by the Calculation Agent under certain circumstances, as described under “Reference Assets—Equity Securities—Share Adjustments Relating to Securities with an Equity Security as a Reference Asset” in the accompanying prospectus supplement. PS—8 HYPOTHETICAL EXAMPLES OF AMOUNTS PAYABLE ON A SINGLE CONTINGENT COUPON PAYMENT DATE The following examples demonstrate the circumstances under which you may receive a Contingent Coupon on a hypothetical Contingent Coupon Payment Date. The numbers appearing in these tables are purely hypothetical and are provided for illustrative purposes only. These examples do not take into account any tax consequences from investing in the Notes and make the following key assumptions: ■ Hypothetical Initial Value of each Reference Asset: $100.00* ■ Hypothetical Coupon Barrier Value for each Reference Asset: $60.00 (60.00% of the hypothetical Initial Value set forth above)* ■ Hypothetical Call Value for each Reference Asset: $100.00 (100.00% of the hypothetical Initial Value set forth above)* * The hypothetical Initial Value of $100.00, the hypothetical Coupon Barrier Value of $60.00 and the hypothetical Call Value of $100.00 for each Reference Asset have been chosen for illustrative purposes only and do not represent a likely Initial Value, Coupon Barrier Value or Call Value for any Reference Asset. The actual Initial Value for each Reference Asset will be equal to its Closing Value on the Initial Valuation Date and the actual Coupon Barrier Value and Call Value for each Reference Asset will be equal to 60.00% and 100.00%, respectively, of its Initial Value. Example 1: The Closing Value of each Reference Asset is greater than its Coupon Barrier Value on the relevant Observation Date. Reference Asset Closing Value on Relevant Observation Date AAPL $99.00 AMZN $65.00 TSLA $70.00 Because the Closing Value of each Reference Asset is greater than its respective Coupon Barrier Value, you will receive a Contingent Coupon of $16.667 (1.6667% of the principal amount per Note) on the related Contingent Coupon Payment Date. Example 2: The Closing Value of one Reference Asset is greater than its Coupon Barrier Value on the relevant Observation Date and the Closing Value of at least one Reference Asset is less than its Coupon Barrier Value on the relevant Observation Date. Reference Asset Closing Value on Relevant Observation Date AAPL $70.00 AMZN $59.00 TSLA $40.00 Because the Closing Value of at least one Reference Asset is less than its Coupon Barrier Value, you will not receive a Contingent Coupon on the related Contingent Coupon Payment Date. Example 3: The Closing Value of each Reference Asset is less than its Coupon Barrier Value on the relevant Observation Date. Reference Asset Closing Value on Relevant Observation Date AAPL $58.00 AMZN $40.00 TSLA $35.00 Because the Closing Value of at least one Reference Asset is less than its Coupon Barrier Value, you will not receive a Contingent Coupon on the related Contingent Coupon Payment Date. Examples 2 and 3 demonstrate that you may not receive a Contingent Coupon on a Contingent Coupon Payment Date. If the Closing Value of any Reference Asset is below its Coupon Barrier Value on each Observation Date, you will not receive any Contingent Coupons during the term of the Notes. In each of the examples above, because the Closing Value of at least one Reference Asset is below its Call Value on the relevant Call Valuation Date, the Notes will not be redeemed on such date. The Notes will be redeemed only if the Closing Value of each Reference Asset on any Call Valuation Date is greater than or equal to its respective Call Value. PS—9 HYPOTHETICAL EXAMPLES OF AMOUNTS PAYABLE UPON AUTOMATIC CALL The following examples demonstrate the hypothetical total return upon an Automatic Call under various circumstances. The “total return” as used in these examples is the number, expressed as a percentage, that results from comparing the aggregate payments per $1,000 principal amount Note to $1,000. The hypothetical total returns set forth below are for illustrative purposes only and may not be the actual total returns applicable to a purchaser of the Notes. The numbers appearing in the following tables and examples have been rounded for ease of analysis. The hypothetical examples below do not take into account any tax consequences from investing in the Notes and make the following key assumption: ■ For each Observation Date that is not also a Call Valuation Date, the Closing Value of at least one Reference Asset is less than its Coupon Barrier Value. Accordingly, you will NOT receive Contingent Coupons on those Observation Dates, unless indicated otherwise below. Example 1: The Notes are redeemed on the first Call Valuation Date. Call Valuation Date Is the Closing Value of any Reference Asset Less Than its Coupon Barrier Value? Is the Closing Value of any Reference Asset Less Than its Call Value? Payment on Contingent Coupon Payment Date (per $1,000 principal amount Note) 1 No No $1,016.667 Because the Closing Value of each Reference Asset on the first Call Valuation Date is greater than or equal to its Call Value, the Notes are redeemed and you will receive the Redemption Price on the related Call Settlement Date. The Notes will cease to be outstanding after the Call Settlement Date, and you will not receive any further payments on the Notes. The total return on investment of the Notes is 1.6667%. Example 2: The Notes are redeemed on the third Call Valuation Date. Call Valuation Date Is the Closing Value of any Reference Asset Less Than its Coupon Barrier Value? Is the Closing Value of any Reference Asset Less Than its Call Value? Payment on Contingent Coupon Payment Date (per $1,000 principal amount Note) 1 No Yes $16.667 2 Yes Yes $0.00 3 No No $1,016.667 Because the Closing Value of each Reference Asset on the third Call Valuation Date is greater than or equal to its Call Value, the Notes are redeemed and you will receive the Redemption Price on the related Call Settlement Date. The Notes will cease to be outstanding after the Call Settlement Date, and you will not receive any further payments on the Notes. The total return on investment of the Notes is 3.3334%. Example 3: The Notes are redeemed on the final Call Valuation Date. Call Valuation Date Is the Closing Value of any Reference Asset Less Than its Coupon Barrier Value? Is the Closing Value of any Reference Asset Less Than its Call Value? Payment on Contingent Coupon Payment Date (per $1,000 principal amount Note) 1 Yes Yes $0.00 2 - 29 With respect to each Call Valuation Date, Yes With respect to each Call Valuation Date, Yes $0.00 30 No No $1,016.667 Because the Closing Value of each Reference Asset on the final Call Valuation Date is greater than or equal to its Call Value, the Notes are redeemed and you will receive the Redemption Price on the related Call Settlement Date. Example 3 demonstrates that the Closing Value of at least one Reference Asset is less than its Coupon Barrier Value on each Observation Date prior to the final Call Valuation Date. Accordingly, no Contingent Coupons are payable on the Notes until the final Call Valuation Date. The Notes will cease to be outstanding after the Call Settlement Date, and you will not receive any further payments on the Notes. The total return on investment of the Notes is 1.6667%. Each of the examples above demonstrate that the return on the Notes upon an Automatic Call will be limited to the Contingent Coupons, if any, that may be payable on the Notes up to and including the applicable Call Settlement Date. PS—10 Each of the examples above demonstrate that a Contingent Coupon will be payable on a Contingent Coupon Payment Date only if the Closing Value of each Reference Asset is greater than or equal to its respective Coupon Barrier Value on an Observation Date. If the Closing Value of any Reference Asset on an Observation Date is less than its Coupon Barrier Value, you will not receive a Contingent Coupon on the related Contingent Coupon Payment Date. If the Closing Value of any Reference Asset is less than its Coupon Barrier Value on each Observation Date, you will not receive any Contingent Coupons during the term of the Notes. PS—11 HYPOTHETICAL EXAMPLES OF AMOUNTS PAYABLE AT MATURITY The following table illustrates the hypothetical payment at maturity under various circumstances. The examples set forth below are purely hypothetical and are provided for illustrative purposes only. The numbers appearing in the following table and examples have been rounded for ease of analysis. The hypothetical examples below do not take into account any tax consequences from investing in the Notes and make the following key assumptions: ■ Hypothetical Initial Value of each Reference Asset: $100.00* ■ Hypothetical Coupon Barrier Value for each Reference Asset: $60.00 (60.00% of the hypothetical Initial Value set forth above)* ■ Hypothetical Barrier Value for each Reference Asset: $60.00 (60.00% of the hypothetical Initial Value set forth above)* ■ You hold the Notes to maturity, and the Notes are NOT redeemed prior to scheduled maturity. * The hypothetical Initial Value of $100.00, the hypothetical Coupon Barrier Value of $60.00 and the hypothetical Barrier Value of $60.00 for each Reference Asset have been chosen for illustrative purposes only and do not represent a likely Initial Value, Coupon Barrier Value or Barrier Value for any Reference Asset. The actual Initial Value for each Reference Asset will be equal to its Closing Value on the Initial Valuation Date, and the actual Coupon Barrier Value and Barrier Value for each Reference Asset will each be equal to 60.00% of its Initial Value.

The following examples illustrate how the payments at maturity set forth in the table above are calculated: Example 1: The Final Value of Reference Asset A is $135.00, the Final Value of Reference Asset B is $130.00 and the Final Value of Reference Asset C is $140.00. Because Reference Asset B has the lowest Reference Asset Return, Reference Asset B is the Least Performing Reference Asset. Because the Final Value of the Least Performing Reference Asset is greater than or equal to its Barrier Value, you will receive a payment at maturity of $1,000 per $1,000 principal amount Note that you hold (plus the Contingent Coupon that will otherwise be payable on the Maturity Date). PS—12 Example 2: The Final Value of Reference Asset A is $140.00, the Final Value of Reference Asset B is $90.00 and the Final Value of Reference Asset C is $105.00. Because Reference Asset B has the lowest Reference Asset Return, Reference Asset B is the Least Performing Reference Asset. Because the Final Value of the Least Performing Reference Asset is greater than or equal to its Barrier Value, you will receive a payment at maturity of $1,000 per $1,000 principal amount Note that you hold (plus the Contingent Coupon that will otherwise be payable on the Maturity Date). Example 3: The Final Value of Reference Asset A is $135.00, the Final Value of Reference Asset B is $50.00 and the Final Value of Reference Asset C is $110.00. Because Reference Asset B has the lowest Reference Asset Return, Reference Asset B is the Least Performing Reference Asset. Because the Final Value of the Least Performing Reference Asset is less than its Barrier Value, you will receive a payment at maturity of $500.00 per $1,000 principal amount Note that you hold, calculated as follows: $1,000 + [$1,000 × Reference Asset Return of the Least Performing Reference Asset] $1,000 + [$1,000 × -50.00%] = $500.00 In addition, because the Final Value of at least one Reference Asset is less than its Coupon Barrier Value, you will not receive a Contingent Coupon on the Maturity Date. Example 3 demonstrates that if the Notes are not redeemed prior to scheduled maturity, and if the Final Value of the Least Performing Reference Asset is less than its Barrier Value, your investment in the Notes will be fully exposed to the decline of the Least Performing Reference Asset from its Initial Value. You will not benefit in any way from the Reference Asset Return of any other Reference Asset being higher than the Reference Asset Return of the Least Performing Reference Asset. If the Notes are not redeemed prior to scheduled maturity, you may lose up to 100.00% of the principal amount of your Notes. Any payment on the Notes, including the repayment of principal, is subject to the credit risk of Barclays Bank PLC. PS—13 SELECTED RISK CONSIDERATIONS An investment in the Notes involves significant risks. Investing in the Notes is not equivalent to investing directly in the Reference Assets or their components, if any. Some of the risks that apply to an investment in the Notes are summarized below, but we urge you to read the more detailed explanation of risks relating to the Notes generally in the “Risk Factors” section of the prospectus supplement. You should not purchase the Notes unless you understand and can bear the risks of investing in the Notes. Risks Relating to the Notes Generally ● Your Investment in the Notes May Result in a Significant Loss — The Notes differ from ordinary debt securities in that the Issuer will not necessarily repay the full principal amount of the Notes at maturity. If the Notes are not redeemed prior to scheduled maturity, and if the Final Value of the Least Performing Reference Asset is less than its Barrier Value, your Notes will be fully exposed to the decline of the Least Performing Reference Asset from its Initial Value. You may lose up to 100.00% of the principal amount of your Notes. ● Potential Return is Limited to the Contingent Coupons, If Any, and You Will Not Participate in Any Appreciation of Any Reference Asset — The potential positive return on the Notes is limited to the Contingent Coupons, if any, that may be payable during the term of the Notes. You will not participate in any appreciation in the value of any Reference Asset, which may be significant, even though you will be exposed to the depreciation in the value of the Least Performing Reference Asset if the Notes are not redeemed and the Final Value of the Least Performing Reference Asset is less than its Barrier Value. ● You May Not Receive Any Contingent Coupon Payments on the Notes — The Issuer will not necessarily make periodic coupon payments on the Notes. You will receive a Contingent Coupon on a Contingent Coupon Payment Date only if the Closing Value of each Reference Asset on the related Observation Date is greater than or equal to its respective Coupon Barrier Value. If the Closing Value of any Reference Asset on an Observation Date is less than its Coupon Barrier Value, you will not receive a Contingent Coupon on the related Contingent Coupon Payment Date. If the Closing Value of at least one Reference Asset is less than its respective Coupon Barrier Value on each Observation Date, you will not receive any Contingent Coupons during the term of the Notes. ● Because the Notes Are Linked to the Least Performing Reference Asset, You Are Exposed to Greater Risks of No Contingent Coupons and Sustaining a Significant Loss of Principal at Maturity Than If the Notes Were Linked to a Single Reference Asset — The risk that you will not receive any Contingent Coupons and lose a significant portion or all of your principal amount in the Notes at maturity is greater if you invest in the Notes as opposed to substantially similar securities that are linked to the performance of a single Reference Asset. With multiple Reference Assets, it is more likely that the Closing Value of at least one Reference Asset will be less than its Coupon Barrier Value on the specified Observation Dates or less than its Barrier Value on the Final Valuation Date, and therefore, it is more likely that you will not receive any Contingent Coupons and that you will suffer a significant loss of principal at maturity. Further, the performance of the Reference Assets may not be correlated or may be negatively correlated. The lower the correlation between multiple Reference Assets, the greater the potential for one of those Reference Assets to close below its Coupon Barrier Value or Barrier Value on an Observation Date or the Final Valuation Date, respectively. It is impossible to predict what the correlation among the Reference Assets will be over the term of the Notes. The Reference Assets represent different equity markets. These different equity markets may not perform similarly over the term of the Notes. Although the correlation of the Reference Assets’ performance may change over the term of the Notes, the Contingent Coupon rate is determined, in part, based on the correlation of the Reference Assets’ performance calculated using our internal models at the time when the terms of the Notes are finalized. A higher Contingent Coupon is generally associated with lower correlation of the Reference Assets, which reflects a greater potential for missed Contingent Coupons and for a loss of principal at maturity. ● You Are Exposed to the Market Risk of Each Reference Asset — Your return on the Notes is not linked to a basket consisting of the Reference Assets. Rather, it will be contingent upon the independent performance of each Reference Asset. Unlike an instrument with a return linked to a basket of underlying assets in which risk is mitigated and diversified among all the components of the basket, you will be exposed to the risks related to each Reference Asset. Poor performance by any Reference Asset over the term of the Notes may negatively affect your return and will not be offset or mitigated by any increases or lesser declines in the value of any other Reference Asset. To receive a Contingent Coupon, the Closing Value of each Reference Asset must be greater than or equal to its Coupon Barrier Value on the applicable Observation Date. In addition, if the Notes have not been redeemed prior to scheduled maturity, and if the Final Value of any Reference Asset is less than its Barrier Value, you will be exposed to the full decline in the Least Performing Reference Asset from its Initial Value. Accordingly, your investment is subject to the market risk of each Reference Asset. ● The Notes Are Subject to Volatility Risk — Volatility is a measure of the degree of variation in the price of an asset (or level of an index) over a period of time. The amount of any coupon payments that may be payable under the Notes is based on a number of factors, including the expected volatility of the Reference Assets. The amount of such coupon payments will be paid at a per annum rate that is higher than the fixed rate that we would pay on a conventional debt security of the same tenor and is higher than it otherwise would have been had the expected volatility of the Reference Assets been lower. As volatility of a Reference Asset increases, there will typically be a greater likelihood that (a) the Closing Value of that Reference Asset on one or more Observation Dates will be less than its Coupon Barrier Value and (b) the Final Value of that Reference Asset will be less than its Barrier Value. PS—14 Accordingly, you should understand that a higher coupon payment amount reflects, among other things, an indication of a greater likelihood that you will (a) not receive coupon payments with respect to one or more Observation Dates and/or (b) incur a loss of principal at maturity than would have been the case had the amount of such coupon payments been lower. In addition, actual volatility over the term of the Notes may be significantly higher than the expected volatility at the time the terms of the Notes were determined. If actual volatility is higher than expected, you will face an even greater risk that you will not receive coupon payments and/or that you will lose some or all of your principal at maturity for the reasons described above. ● Early Redemption and Reinvestment Risk — While the original term of the Notes is as indicated on the cover of this pricing supplement, the Notes may be redeemed prior to maturity, as described above, and the holding period over which you may receive any coupon payments that may be payable under the Notes could be as short as approximately six months. The Redemption Price that you would receive on a Call Settlement Date, together with any coupon payments that you may have received prior to the Call Settlement Date, may be less than the aggregate amount of payments that you would have received had the Notes not been redeemed. There is no guarantee that you would be able to reinvest the proceeds from an investment in the Notes in a comparable investment with a similar level of risk in the event the Notes are redeemed prior to the Maturity Date. No additional payments will be due after the relevant Call Settlement Date. The fact that the Notes may be redeemed prior to maturity may also adversely impact your ability to sell your Notes and the price at which they may be sold. ● Any Payment on the Notes Will Be Determined Based on the Closing Values of the Reference Assets on the Dates Specified — Any payment on the Notes will be determined based on the Closing Values of the Reference Assets on the dates specified. You will not benefit from any more favorable values of the Reference Assets determined at any other time. ● Contingent Repayment of Any Principal Amount Applies Only at Maturity or upon Any Redemption — You should be willing to hold your Notes to maturity or any redemption. Although the Notes provide for the contingent repayment of the principal amount of your Notes at maturity, provided that the Final Value of the Least Performing Reference Asset is greater than or equal to its Barrier Value, or upon any redemption, if you sell your Notes prior to such time in the secondary market, if any, you may have to sell your Notes at a price that is less than the principal amount even if at that time the value of each Reference Asset has increased from its Initial Value. See “Many Economic and Market Factors Will Impact the Value of the Notes” below. ● Owning the Notes is Not the Same as Owning Any Reference Asset or Any Securities to which Any Reference Asset Provides Exposure — The return on the Notes may not reflect the return you would realize if you actually owned any Reference Asset or any securities to which any Reference Asset provides exposure. As a holder of the Notes, you will not have voting rights or rights to receive dividends or other distributions or any other rights that holders of any Reference Asset or any securities to which any Reference Asset provides exposure may have. ● Tax Treatment — Significant aspects of the tax treatment of the Notes are uncertain. You should consult your tax advisor about your tax situation. See “Tax Considerations” below. Risks Relating to the Issuer ● Credit of Issuer — The Notes are unsecured and unsubordinated debt obligations of the Issuer, Barclays Bank PLC, and are not, either directly or indirectly, an obligation of any third party. Any payment to be made on the Notes, including any repayment of principal, is subject to the ability of Barclays Bank PLC to satisfy its obligations as they come due and is not guaranteed by any third party. As a result, the actual and perceived creditworthiness of Barclays Bank PLC may affect the market value of the Notes, and in the event Barclays Bank PLC were to default on its obligations, you may not receive any amounts owed to you under the terms of the Notes. ● You May Lose Some or All of Your Investment If Any U.K. Bail-in Power Is Exercised by the Relevant U.K. Resolution Authority — Notwithstanding and to the exclusion of any other term of the Notes or any other agreements, arrangements or understandings between Barclays Bank PLC and any holder or beneficial owner of the Notes (or the Trustee on behalf of the holders of the Notes), by acquiring the Notes, each holder and beneficial owner of the Notes acknowledges, accepts, agrees to be bound by, and consents to the exercise of, any U.K. Bail-in Power by the relevant U.K. resolution authority as set forth under “Consent to U.K. Bail-in Power” in this pricing supplement. Accordingly, any U.K. Bail-in Power may be exercised in such a manner as to result in you and other holders and beneficial owners of the Notes losing all or a part of the value of your investment in the Notes or receiving a different security from the Notes, which may be worth significantly less than the Notes and which may have significantly fewer protections than those typically afforded to debt securities. Moreover, the relevant U.K. resolution authority may exercise the U.K. Bail-in Power without providing any advance notice to, or requiring the consent of, the holders and beneficial owners of the Notes. The exercise of any U.K. Bail-in Power by the relevant U.K. resolution authority with respect to the Notes will not be a default or an Event of Default (as each term is defined in the senior debt securities indenture) and the trustee will not be liable for any action that the trustee takes, or abstains from taking, in either case, in accordance with the exercise of the U.K. Bail-in Power by the relevant U.K. resolution authority with respect to the Notes. See “Consent to U.K. Bail-in Power” in this pricing supplement as well as “U.K. Bail-in Power,” “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to the Securities Generally—Regulatory action in the event a bank or investment firm in the Group is failing or likely to fail, including the exercise by the relevant U.K. resolution authority of a variety of statutory resolution powers, could materially adversely affect the value of any securities” and “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to the Securities Generally—Under the terms of the securities, you have agreed to be bound by the exercise of any U.K. Bail-in Power by the relevant U.K. resolution authority” in the accompanying prospectus supplement. PS—15 Risks Relating to the Reference Assets ● Historical Performance of the Reference Assets Should Not Be Taken as Any Indication of the Future Performance of the Reference Assets Over the Term of the Notes — The value of each Reference Asset has fluctuated in the past and may, in the future, experience significant fluctuations. The historical performance of a Reference Asset is not an indication of the future performance of that Reference Asset over the term of the Notes. The historical correlation among the Reference Assets is not an indication of the future correlation among them over the term of the Notes. Therefore, the performance of the Reference Assets individually or in comparison to each other over the term of the Notes may bear no relation or resemblance to the historical performance of any Reference Asset. ● Single Equity Risk — The values of the Reference Assets can rise or fall sharply due to factors specific to each Reference Asset and its issuer, such as stock price volatility, earnings, financial conditions, corporate, industry and regulatory developments, management changes and decisions and other events, as well as general market factors, such as general stock market volatility and levels, interest rates and economic and political conditions. We urge you to review financial and other information filed periodically with the SEC by the issuers of the Reference Assets. We have not undertaken any independent review or due diligence of the SEC filings of the issuers of the Reference Assets or of any other publicly available information regarding any such issuer. ● Anti-Dilution Protection Is Limited, and the Calculation Agent Has Discretion to Make Anti-Dilution Adjustments — The Calculation Agent may in its sole discretion make adjustments affecting the amounts payable on the Notes upon the occurrence of certain corporate events (such as stock splits or extraordinary or special dividends) that the Calculation Agent determines have a diluting or concentrative effect on the theoretical value of any Reference Asset. However, the Calculation Agent might not make such adjustments in response to all events that could affect any Reference Asset. The occurrence of any such event and any adjustment made by the Calculation Agent (or a determination by the Calculation Agent not to make any adjustment) may adversely affect any amounts payable on the Notes. See “Reference Assets—Equity Securities—Share Adjustments Relating to Securities with an Equity Security as a Reference Asset” in the accompanying prospectus supplement. ● Reorganization Or Other Events Could Adversely Affect the Value of the Notes Or Result in the Notes Being Accelerated — Upon the occurrence of certain reorganization events or a nationalization, expropriation, liquidation, bankruptcy, insolvency or de-listing of any Reference Asset, the Calculation Agent will make adjustments to that Reference Asset that may result in payments on the Notes being based on the performance of shares, cash or other assets distributed to holders of that Reference Asset upon the occurrence of such event or, in some cases, the Calculation Agent may accelerate the maturity date for a payment determined by the Calculation Agent. Any of these actions could adversely affect the value of any Reference Asset and, consequently, the value of the Notes. Any amount payable upon acceleration could be significantly less than the amount(s) that would be due on the Notes if they were not accelerated. See “Reference Assets—Equity Securities—Share Adjustments Relating to Securities with an Equity Security as a Reference Asset” in the accompanying prospectus supplement. Risks Relating to Conflicts of Interest ● We and Our Affiliates May Engage in Various Activities or Make Determinations That Could Materially Affect the Notes in Various Ways and Create Conflicts of Interest — We and our affiliates play a variety of roles in connection with the issuance of the Notes, as described below. In performing these roles, our and our affiliates’ economic interests are potentially adverse to your interests as an investor in the Notes. In connection with our normal business activities and in connection with hedging our obligations under the Notes, we and our affiliates make markets in and trade various financial instruments or products for our accounts and for the account of our clients and otherwise provide investment banking and other financial services with respect to these financial instruments and products. These financial instruments and products may include securities, derivative instruments or assets that may relate to the Reference Assets or their components, if any. In any such market making, trading and hedging activity, and other financial services, we or our affiliates may take positions or take actions that are inconsistent with, or adverse to, the investment objectives of the holders of the Notes. We and our affiliates have no obligation to take the needs of any buyer, seller or holder of the Notes into account in conducting these activities. Such market making, trading and hedging activity, investment banking and other financial services may negatively impact the value of the Notes. In addition, the role played by Barclays Capital Inc., as the agent for the Notes, could present significant conflicts of interest with the role of Barclays Bank PLC, as issuer of the Notes. For example, Barclays Capital Inc. or its representatives may derive compensation or financial benefit from the distribution of the Notes and such compensation or financial benefit may serve as incentive to sell the Notes instead of other investments. Furthermore, we and our affiliates establish the offering price of the Notes for initial sale to the public, and the offering price is not based upon any independent verification or valuation. In addition to the activities described above, we will also act as the Calculation Agent for the Notes. As Calculation Agent, we will determine any values of the Reference Assets and make any other determinations necessary to calculate any payments on the Notes. In making these determinations, the Calculation Agent may be required to make discretionary judgements relating to the Reference Assets, including determining whether a market disruption event has occurred or whether certain adjustments to the Reference Assets or other terms of the Notes are necessary, as further described in the accompanying prospectus supplement. In making these discretionary judgments, our economic interests are potentially adverse to your interests as an investor in the Notes, and any of these determinations may adversely affect any payments on the Notes. PS—16 Risks Relating to the Estimated Value of the Notes and the Secondary Market ● The Estimated Value of Your Notes is Expected to be Lower Than the Initial Issue Price of Your Notes — The estimated value of your Notes on the Initial Valuation Date is expected to be lower, and may be significantly lower, than the initial issue price of your Notes. The difference between the initial issue price of your Notes and the estimated value of the Notes is a result of certain factors, such as any sales commissions to be paid to Barclays Capital Inc. or another affiliate of ours, any selling concessions, discounts, commissions or fees (including any structuring or other distribution related fees) to be allowed or paid to non-affiliated intermediaries, the estimated profit that we or any of our affiliates expect to earn in connection with structuring the Notes, the estimated cost which we may incur in hedging our obligations under the Notes, and estimated development and other costs which we may incur in connection with the Notes. ● The Estimated Value of Your Notes Might be Lower if Such Estimated Value Were Based on the Levels at Which Our Debt Securities Trade in the Secondary Market — The estimated value of your Notes on the Initial Valuation Date is based on a number of variables, including our internal funding rates. Our internal funding rates may vary from the levels at which our benchmark debt securities trade in the secondary market. As a result of this difference, the estimated value referenced above might be lower if such estimated value were based on the levels at which our benchmark debt securities trade in the secondary market. ● The Estimated Value of the Notes is Based on Our Internal Pricing Models, Which May Prove to be Inaccurate and May be Different from the Pricing Models of Other Financial Institutions — The estimated value of your Notes on the Initial Valuation Date is based on our internal pricing models, which take into account a number of variables and are based on a number of subjective assumptions, which may or may not materialize. These variables and assumptions are not evaluated or verified on an independent basis. Further, our pricing models may be different from other financial institutions’ pricing models and the methodologies used by us to estimate the value of the Notes may not be consistent with those of other financial institutions which may be purchasers or sellers of Notes in the secondary market. As a result, the secondary market price of your Notes may be materially different from the estimated value of the Notes determined by reference to our internal pricing models. ● The Estimated Value of Your Notes Is Not a Prediction of the Prices at Which You May Sell Your Notes in the Secondary Market, if any, and Such Secondary Market Prices, If Any, Will Likely be Lower Than the Initial Issue Price of Your Notes and May be Lower Than the Estimated Value of Your Notes — The estimated value of the Notes will not be a prediction of the prices at which Barclays Capital Inc., other affiliates of ours or third parties may be willing to purchase the Notes from you in secondary market transactions (if they are willing to purchase, which they are not obligated to do). The price at which you may be able to sell your Notes in the secondary market at any time will be influenced by many factors that cannot be predicted, such as market conditions, and any bid and ask spread for similar sized trades, and may be substantially less than our estimated value of the Notes. Further, as secondary market prices of your Notes take into account the levels at which our debt securities trade in the secondary market, and do not take into account our various costs related to the Notes such as fees, commissions, discounts, and the costs of hedging our obligations under the Notes, secondary market prices of your Notes will likely be lower than the initial issue price of your Notes. As a result, the price at which Barclays Capital Inc., other affiliates of ours or third parties may be willing to purchase the Notes from you in secondary market transactions, if any, will likely be lower than the price you paid for your Notes, and any sale prior to the Maturity Date could result in a substantial loss to you. ● The Temporary Price at Which We May Initially Buy The Notes in the Secondary Market And the Value We May Initially Use for Customer Account Statements, If We Provide Any Customer Account Statements At All, May Not Be Indicative of Future Prices of Your Notes — Assuming that all relevant factors remain constant after the Initial Valuation Date, the price at which Barclays Capital Inc. may initially buy or sell the Notes in the secondary market (if Barclays Capital Inc. makes a market in the Notes, which it is not obligated to do) and the value that we may initially use for customer account statements, if we provide any customer account statements at all, may exceed our estimated value of the Notes on the Initial Valuation Date, as well as the secondary market value of the Notes, for a temporary period after the initial Issue Date of the Notes. The price at which Barclays Capital Inc. may initially buy or sell the Notes in the secondary market and the value that we may initially use for customer account statements may not be indicative of future prices of your Notes. ● Lack of Liquidity — The Notes will not be listed on any securities exchange. Barclays Capital Inc. and other affiliates of Barclays Bank PLC intend to make a secondary market for the Notes but are not required to do so, and may discontinue any such secondary market making at any time, without notice. Barclays Capital Inc. may at any time hold unsold inventory, which may inhibit the development of a secondary market for the Notes. Even if there is a secondary market, it may not provide enough liquidity to allow you to trade or sell the Notes easily. Because other dealers are not likely to make a secondary market for the Notes, the price at which you may be able to trade your Notes is likely to depend on the price, if any, at which Barclays Capital Inc. and other affiliates of Barclays Bank PLC are willing to buy the Notes. The Notes are not designed to be short-term trading instruments. Accordingly, you should be willing and able to hold your Notes to maturity. ● Many Economic and Market Factors Will Impact the Value of the Notes — The value of the Notes will be affected by a number of economic and market factors that interact in complex and unpredictable ways and that may either offset or magnify each other, including: o the market price of, dividend rate on and expected volatility of the Reference Assets or the components of the Reference Assets, if any; o correlation (or lack of correlation) of the Reference Assets; PS—17 o the time to maturity of the Notes; o interest and yield rates in the market generally; o a variety of economic, financial, political, regulatory or judicial events; o supply and demand for the Notes; and o our creditworthiness, including actual or anticipated downgrades in our credit ratings. PS—18 INFORMATION REGARDING THE REFERENCE ASSETS We urge you to read the following section in the accompanying prospectus supplement: “Reference Assets—Equity Securities—Reference Asset Issuer and Reference Asset Information.” Companies with securities registered under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, which is commonly referred to as the “Exchange Act,” and the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended, which is commonly referred to as the “’40 Act,” are required to periodically file certain financial and other information specified by the SEC.

Historical Performance of the Common Stock of Tesla, Inc. PAST PERFORMANCE IS NOT INDICATIVE OF FUTURE RESULTS PS—21 TAX CONSIDERATIONS You should review carefully the sections in the accompanying prospectus supplement entitled “Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences—Tax Consequences to U.S. Holders—Notes Treated as Prepaid Forward or Derivative Contracts with Associated Contingent Coupons” and, if you are a non-U.S. holder, “—Tax Consequences to Non-U.S. Holders.” The following discussion supersedes the discussion in the accompanying prospectus supplement to the extent it is inconsistent therewith. In determining our reporting responsibilities, if any, we intend to treat (i) the Notes for U.S. federal income tax purposes as prepaid forward contracts with associated contingent coupons and (ii) any Contingent Coupon payments as ordinary income, as described in the section entitled “Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences—Tax Consequences to U.S. Holders—Notes Treated as Prepaid Forward or Derivative Contracts with Associated Contingent Coupons” in the accompanying prospectus supplement. Our special tax counsel, Davis Polk & Wardwell LLP, has advised that it believes this treatment to be reasonable, but that there are other reasonable treatments that the Internal Revenue Service (the “IRS”) or a court may adopt. Sale, exchange or redemption of a Note. Assuming the treatment described above is respected, upon a sale or exchange of the Notes (including redemption upon an automatic call or at maturity), you should recognize capital gain or loss equal to the difference between the amount realized on the sale or exchange and your tax basis in the Notes, which should equal the amount you paid to acquire the Notes (assuming Contingent Coupon payments are properly treated as ordinary income, consistent with the position referred to above). This gain or loss should be short-term capital gain or loss unless you hold the Notes for more than one year, in which case the gain or loss should be long-term capital gain or loss, whether or not you are an initial purchaser of the Notes at the issue price. The deductibility of capital losses is subject to limitations. If you sell your Notes between the time your right to a Contingent Coupon payment is fixed and the time it is paid, it is likely that you will be treated as receiving ordinary income equal to the Contingent Coupon payment. Although uncertain, it is possible that proceeds received from the sale or exchange of your Notes prior to an Observation Date but that can be attributed to an expected Contingent Coupon payment could be treated as ordinary income. You should consult your tax advisor regarding this issue. As noted above, there are other reasonable treatments that the IRS or a court may adopt, in which case the timing and character of any income or loss on the Notes could be materially affected. In addition, in 2007 the U.S. Treasury Department and the IRS released a notice requesting comments on the U.S. federal income tax treatment of “prepaid forward contracts” and similar instruments. The notice focuses in particular on whether to require investors in these instruments to accrue income over the term of their investment. It also asks for comments on a number of related topics, including the character of income or loss with respect to these instruments and the relevance of factors such as the nature of the underlying property to which the instruments are linked. While the notice requests comments on appropriate transition rules and effective dates, any Treasury regulations or other guidance promulgated after consideration of these issues could materially affect the tax consequences of an investment in the Notes, possibly with retroactive effect. You should consult your tax advisor regarding the U.S. federal income tax consequences of an investment in the Notes, including possible alternative treatments and the issues presented by this notice. Non-U.S. holders. Insofar as we have responsibility as a withholding agent, we do not currently intend to treat Contingent Coupon payments to non-U.S. holders (as defined in the accompanying prospectus supplement) as subject to U.S. withholding tax. However, non-U.S. holders should in any event expect to be required to provide appropriate Forms W-8 or other documentation in order to establish an exemption from backup withholding, as described under the heading “—Information Reporting and Backup Withholding” in the accompanying prospectus supplement. If any withholding is required, we will not be required to pay any additional amounts with respect to amounts withheld. Treasury regulations under Section 871(m) generally impose a withholding tax on certain “dividend equivalents” under certain “equity linked instruments.” A recent IRS notice excludes from the scope of Section 871(m) instruments issued prior to January 1, 2025 that do not have a “delta of one” with respect to underlying securities that could pay U.S.-source dividends for U.S. federal income tax purposes (each an “Underlying Security”). Based on our determination that the Notes do not have a “delta of one” within the meaning of the regulations, we expect that these regulations will not apply to the Notes with regard to non-U.S. holders. Our determination is not binding on the IRS, and the IRS may disagree with this determination. Section 871(m) is complex and its application may depend on your particular circumstances, including whether you enter into other transactions with respect to an Underlying Security. If necessary, further information regarding the potential application of Section 871(m) will be provided in the pricing supplement for the Notes. You should consult your tax advisor regarding the potential application of Section 871(m) to the Notes. PS—22 SUPPLEMENTAL PLAN OF DISTRIBUTION We will agree to sell to Barclays Capital Inc. (the “Agent”), and the Agent will agree to purchase from us, the principal amount of the Notes, and at the price, specified on the cover of this pricing supplement. The Agent will commit to take and pay for all of the Notes, if any are taken. PS—23\n",

PS—3 CONSENT TO U.K. BAIL-IN POWER Notwithstanding and to the exclusion of any other term of the Notes or any other agreements, arrangements or understandings between us and any holder or beneficial owner of the Notes (or the Trustee on behalf of the holders of the Notes), by acquiring the Notes, each holder and beneficial owner of the Notes acknowledges, accepts, agrees to be bound by, and consents to the exercise of, any U.K. Bail-in Power by the relevant U.K. resolution authority. Under the U.K. Banking Act 2009, as amended, the relevant U.K. resolution authority may exercise a U.K. Bail-in Power in circumstances in which the relevant U.K. resolution authority is satisfied that the resolution conditions are met. These conditions include that a U.K. bank or investment firm is failing or is likely to fail to satisfy the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 (the “FSMA”) threshold conditions for authorization to carry on certain regulated activities (within the meaning of section 55B FSMA) or, in the case of a U.K. banking group company that is a European Economic Area (“EEA”) or third country institution or investment firm, that the relevant EEA or third country relevant authority is satisfied that the resolution conditions are met in respect of that entity. The U.K. Bail-in Power includes any write-down, conversion, transfer, modification and/or suspension power, which allows for (i) the reduction or cancellation of all, or a portion, of the principal amount of, interest on, or any other amounts payable on, the Notes; (ii) the conversion of all, or a portion, of the principal amount of, interest on, or any other amounts payable on, the Notes into shares or other securities or other obligations of Barclays Bank PLC or another person (and the issue to, or conferral on, the holder or beneficial owner of the Notes such shares, securities or obligations); (iii) the cancellation of the Notes and/or (iv) the amendment or alteration of the maturity of the Notes, or amendment of the amount of interest or any other amounts due on the Notes, or the dates on which interest or any other amounts become payable, including by suspending payment for a temporary period; which U.K. Bail-in Power may be exercised by means of a variation of the terms of the Notes solely to give effect to the exercise by the relevant U.K. resolution authority of such U.K. Bail-in Power. Each holder and beneficial owner of the Notes further acknowledges and agrees that the rights of the holders or beneficial owners of the Notes are subject to, and will be varied, if necessary, solely to give effect to, the exercise of any U.K. Bail-in Power by the relevant U.K. resolution authority. For the avoidance of doubt, this consent and acknowledgment is not a waiver of any rights holders or beneficial owners of the Notes may have at law if and to the extent that any U.K. Bail-in Power is exercised by the relevant U.K. resolution authority in breach of laws applicable in England. For more information, please see “Selected Risk Considerations—Risks Relating to the Issuer—You May Lose Some or All of Your Investment If Any U.K. Bail-in Power Is Exercised by the Relevant U.K. Resolution Authority” in this pricing supplement as well as “U.K. Bail-in Power,” “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to the Securities Generally—Regulatory action in the event a bank or investment firm in the Group is failing or likely to fail, including the exercise by the relevant U.K. resolution authority of a variety of statutory resolution powers, could materially adversely affect the value of any securities” and “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to the Securities Generally—Under the terms of the securities, you have agreed to be bound by the exercise of any U.K. Bail-in Power by the relevant U.K. resolution authority” in the accompanying prospectus supplement. PS—4 ADDITIONAL INFORMATION REGARDING OUR ESTIMATED VALUE OF THE NOTES The range of the estimated values of the Notes referenced above may not correlate on a linear basis with the range of any other term of the Notes as may be set forth in this pricing supplement. We determined the size of such range based on prevailing market conditions, as well as the anticipated duration of the marketing period for the Notes. The final terms for the Notes will be determined on the date the Notes are initially priced for sale to the public, which we refer to as the Initial Valuation Date, based on prevailing market conditions on or prior to the Initial Valuation Date, and will be communicated to investors either orally or in a final pricing supplement. Our internal pricing models take into account a number of variables and are based on a number of subjective assumptions, which may or may not materialize, typically including volatility, interest rates, and our internal funding rates. Our internal funding rates (which are our internally published borrowing rates based on variables such as market benchmarks, our appetite for borrowing, and our existing obligations coming to maturity) may vary from the levels at which our benchmark debt securities trade in the secondary market. Our estimated value on the Initial Valuation Date is based on our internal funding rates. Our estimated value of the Notes may be lower if such valuation were based on the levels at which our benchmark debt securities trade in the secondary market. Our estimated value of the Notes on the Initial Valuation Date is expected to be less than the initial issue price of the Notes. The difference between the initial issue price of the Notes and our estimated value of the Notes is a result of several factors, including any sales commissions to be paid to Barclays Capital Inc. or another affiliate of ours, any selling concessions, discounts, commissions or fees (including any structuring or other distribution related fees) to be allowed or paid to non-affiliated intermediaries, the estimated profit that we or any of our affiliates expect to earn in connection with structuring the Notes, the estimated cost which we may incur in hedging our obligations under the Notes, and estimated development and other costs which we may incur in connection with the Notes. Our estimated value on the Initial Valuation Date is not a prediction of the price at which the Notes may trade in the secondary market, nor will it be the price at which Barclays Capital Inc. may buy or sell the Notes in the secondary market. Subject to normal market and funding conditions, Barclays Capital Inc. or another affiliate of ours intends to offer to purchase the Notes in the secondary market but it is not obligated to do so. Assuming that all relevant factors remain constant after the Initial Valuation Date, the price at which Barclays Capital Inc. may initially buy or sell the Notes in the secondary market, if any, and the value that we may initially use for customer account statements, if we provide any customer account statements at all, may exceed our estimated value on the Initial Valuation Date for a temporary period expected to be approximately three months after the Issue Date because, in our discretion, we may elect to effectively reimburse to investors a portion of the estimated cost of hedging our obligations under the Notes and other costs in connection with the Notes which we will no longer expect to incur over the term of the Notes. We made such discretionary election and determined this temporary reimbursement period on the basis of a number of factors, which may include the tenor of the Notes and/or any agreement we may have with the distributors of the Notes. The amount of our estimated costs which we effectively reimburse to investors in this way may not be allocated ratably throughout the reimbursement period, and we may discontinue such reimbursement at any time or revise the duration of the reimbursement period after the initial Issue Date of the Notes based on changes in market conditions and other factors that cannot be predicted. We urge you to read the “Selected Risk Considerations” beginning on page PS-13 of this pricing supplement. You may revoke your offer to purchase the Notes at any time prior to the Initial Valuation Date. We reserve the right to change the terms of, or reject any offer to purchase, the Notes prior to the Initial Valuation Date. In the event of any changes to the terms of the Notes, we will notify you and you will be asked to accept such changes in connection with your purchase. You may also choose to reject such changes in which case we may reject your offer to purchase. PS—5 SELECTED PURCHASE CONSIDERATIONS The Notes are not suitable for all investors. The Notes may be a suitable investment for you if all of the following statements are true: ● You do not seek an investment that produces fixed periodic interest or coupon payments or other non-contingent sources of current income, and you can tolerate receiving few or no Contingent Coupons over the term of the Notes in the event the Closing Value of the Reference Asset falls below the Coupon Barrier Value on one or more of the specified Observation Dates. ● You understand and accept that you will not participate in any appreciation of the Reference Asset, which may be significant, and that your return potential on the Notes is limited to the Contingent Coupons, if any, paid on the Notes. ● You can tolerate a loss of a significant portion or all of the principal amount of your Notes, and you are willing and able to make an investment that may have the full downside market risk of an investment in the Reference Asset. ● You are willing and able to accept the risks associated with receiving shares of the Reference Asset at maturity. ● You do not anticipate that the Closing Value of the Reference Asset will fall below the Coupon Barrier Value on any Observation Date or below the Barrier Value on the Final Valuation Date. ● You understand and accept that you will not be entitled to receive dividends or distributions that may be paid to holders of a Reference Asset or any securities to which a Reference Asset provides exposure, nor will you have any voting rights with respect to a Reference Asset or any securities to which a Reference Asset provides exposure. ● You understand and accept the risks that (a) you will not receive a Contingent Coupon if the Closing Value of the Reference Asset is less than the Coupon Barrier Value on an Observation Date and (b) you will lose some or all of your principal at maturity if the Final Value of the Reference Asset is less than the Barrier Value. ● You understand and accept the risk that, if the Notes are not redeemed prior to scheduled maturity, the payment at maturity, if any, will be based solely on the Reference Asset Return of the Reference Asset. ● You understand and are willing and able to accept the risks associated with an investment linked to the performance of the Reference Asset. ● You are willing and able to accept the risk that the Notes may be redeemed prior to scheduled maturity and that you may not be able to reinvest your money in an alternative investment with comparable risk and yield. ● You can tolerate fluctuations in the price of the Notes prior to scheduled maturity that may be similar to or exceed the downside fluctuations in the value of the Reference Asset. ● You do not seek an investment for which there will be an active secondary market, and you are willing and able to hold the Notes to maturity if the Notes are not redeemed. ● You are willing and able to assume our credit risk for all payments on the Notes. ● You are willing and able to consent to the exercise of any U.K. Bail-in Power by any relevant U.K. resolution authority. The Notes may not be a suitable investment for you if any of the following statements are true: ● You seek an investment that produces fixed periodic interest or coupon payments or other non-contingent sources of current income, and/or you cannot tolerate receiving few or no Contingent Coupons over the term of the Notes in the event the Closing Value of the Reference Asset falls below the Coupon Barrier Value on one or more of the specified Observation Dates. ● You seek an investment that participates in the full appreciation of the Reference Asset rather than an investment with a return that is limited to the Contingent Coupons, if any, paid on the Notes. ● You seek an investment that provides for the full repayment of principal at maturity, and/or you are unwilling or unable to accept the risk that you may lose some or all of the principal amount of the Notes in the event that the Final Value of the Reference Asset falls below the Barrier Value. ● You are unwilling or unable to accept the risks associated with receiving shares of the Reference Asset at maturity. ● You anticipate that the Closing Value of the Reference Asset will decline during the term of the Notes such that the Closing Value of the Reference Asset will fall below the Coupon Barrier Value on one or more Observation Dates and/or the Final Value of the Reference Asset will fall below the Barrier Value. ● You do not understand and/or are unwilling or unable to accept the risks associated with an investment linked to the performance of the Reference Asset. ● You are unwilling or unable to accept the risk that the negative performance of the Reference Asset may cause you to not receive Contingent Coupons and/or suffer a loss of principal at maturity. ● You are unwilling or unable to accept the risk that the Notes may be redeemed prior to scheduled maturity. ● You seek an investment that entitles you to dividends or distributions on, or voting rights related to a Reference Asset or any securities to which a Reference Asset provides exposure. ● You cannot tolerate fluctuations in the price of the Notes prior to scheduled maturity that may be similar to or exceed the downside fluctuations in the value of the Reference Asset. ● You seek an investment for which there will be an active secondary market, and/or you are unwilling or unable to hold the Notes to maturity if the Notes are not redeemed. PS—6 ● You prefer the lower risk, and therefore accept the potentially lower returns, of fixed income investments with comparable maturities and credit ratings. ● You are unwilling or unable to assume our credit risk for all payments on the Notes. ● You are unwilling or unable to consent to the exercise of any U.K. Bail-in Power by any relevant U.K. resolution authority. You must rely on your own evaluation of the merits of an investment in the Notes. You should reach a decision whether to invest in the Notes after carefully considering, with your advisors, the suitability of the Notes in light of your investment objectives and the specific information set out in this pricing supplement and the documents referenced under “Additional Documents Related to the Offering of the Notes” in this pricing supplement. Neither the Issuer nor Barclays Capital Inc. makes any recommendation as to the suitability of the Notes for investment. PS—7 ADDITIONAL TERMS OF THE NOTES The Observation Dates (including the Final Valuation Date), the Contingent Coupon Payment Dates, any Call Settlement Date and the Maturity Date are subject to postponement in certain circumstances, as described under “Reference Assets—Equity Securities—Market Disruption Events for Securities with an Equity Security as a Reference Asset” and “Terms of the Notes—Payment Dates” in the accompanying prospectus supplement. In addition, the Reference Asset and the Notes are subject to adjustment by the Calculation Agent under certain circumstances, as described under “Reference Assets—Equity Securities—Share Adjustments Relating to Securities with an Equity Security as a Reference Asset” in the accompanying prospectus supplement. PS—8 HYPOTHETICAL EXAMPLES OF AMOUNTS PAYABLE UPON AUTOMATIC CALL The following examples demonstrate the hypothetical total return upon an Automatic Call under various circumstances. The “total return” as used in these examples is the number, expressed as a percentage, that results from comparing the aggregate payments per $1,000 principal amount Note to $1,000. The hypothetical total returns set forth below are for illustrative purposes only and may not be the actual total returns applicable to a purchaser of the Notes. The numbers appearing in the following tables and examples have been rounded for ease of analysis. The hypothetical examples below do not take into account any tax consequences from investing in the Notes and make the following key assumption: ■ For each Observation Date that is not also a Call Valuation Date, the Closing Value of the Reference Asset is less than the Coupon Barrier Value. Accordingly, you will NOT receive Contingent Coupons on those Observation Dates, unless indicated otherwise below. Example 1: The Notes are redeemed on the first Call Valuation Date. Call Valuation Date Is the Closing Value of the Reference Asset Less Than the Coupon Barrier Value? Is the Closing Value of the Reference Asset Less Than the Call Value? Payment on Contingent Coupon Payment Date (per $1,000 principal amount Note) 1 No No $1,036.25 Because the Closing Value of the Reference Asset on the first Call Valuation Date is greater than or equal to the Call Value, the Notes are redeemed and you will receive the Redemption Price on the related Call Settlement Date. The Notes will cease to be outstanding after the Call Settlement Date, and you will not receive any further payments on the Notes. The total return on investment of the Notes is 3.625%. Example 2: The Notes are redeemed on the third Call Valuation Date. Call Valuation Date Is the Closing Value of the Reference Asset Less Than the Coupon Barrier Value? Is the Closing Value of the Reference Asset Less Than the Call Value? Payment on Contingent Coupon Payment Date (per $1,000 principal amount Note) 1 No Yes $36.25 2 Yes Yes $0.00 3 No No $1,036.25 Because the Closing Value of the Reference Asset on the third Call Valuation Date is greater than or equal to the Call Value, the Notes are redeemed and you will receive the Redemption Price on the related Call Settlement Date. The Notes will cease to be outstanding after the Call Settlement Date, and you will not receive any further payments on the Notes. The total return on investment of the Notes is 7.25%. Example 3: The Notes are redeemed on the final Call Valuation Date. Call Valuation Date Is the Closing Value of the Reference Asset Less Than the Coupon Barrier Value? Is the Closing Value of the Reference Asset Less Than the Call Value? Payment on Contingent Coupon Payment Date (per $1,000 principal amount Note) 1 Yes Yes $0.00 2 - 5 With respect to each Call Valuation Date, Yes With respect to each Call Valuation Date, Yes $0.00 6 No No $1,036.25 PS—9 Because the Closing Value of the Reference Asset on the final Call Valuation Date is greater than or equal to the Call Value, the Notes are redeemed and you will receive the Redemption Price on the related Call Settlement Date. Example 3 demonstrates that the Closing Value of the Reference Asset is less than its Coupon Barrier Value on each Observation Date prior to the final Call Valuation Date. Accordingly, no Contingent Coupons are payable on the Notes until the final Call Valuation Date. The Notes will cease to be outstanding after the Call Settlement Date, and you will not receive any further payments on the Notes. The total return on investment of the Notes is 3.625%. Each of the examples above demonstrate that the return on the Notes upon an Automatic Call will be limited to the Contingent Coupons, if any, that may be payable on the Notes up to and including the applicable Call Settlement Date. Each of the examples above demonstrate that a Contingent Coupon will be payable on a Contingent Coupon Payment Date only if the Closing Value of the Reference Asset is greater than or equal to the Coupon Barrier Value on an Observation Date. If the Closing Value of the Reference Asset on an Observation Date is less than the Coupon Barrier Value, you will not receive a Contingent Coupon on the related Contingent Coupon Payment Date. If the Closing Value of the Reference Asset is less than the Coupon Barrier Value on each Observation Date, you will not receive any Contingent Coupons during the term of the Notes. PS—10 HYPOTHETICAL EXAMPLES OF AMOUNTS PAYABLE AT MATURITY The following table illustrates the hypothetical payment at maturity under various circumstances. The examples set forth below are purely hypothetical and are provided for illustrative purposes only. The numbers appearing in the following tables and examples have been rounded for ease of analysis. The hypothetical examples below do not take into account any tax consequences from investing in the Notes and make the following key assumptions: ■ You hold the Notes to maturity, and the Notes are NOT redeemed prior to scheduled maturity. ■ Hypothetical Initial Value, Coupon Barrier Value, Barrier Value, Physical Delivery Amount and Fractional Share Amount for the Reference Asset are as follows:* Reference Asset Initial Value Coupon Barrier Value Barrier Value Physical Delivery Amount Fractional Share Amount U.S. Bancorp $150.00 $75.00 $75.00 6 shares 0.66667 shares * The hypothetical Initial Value shown above has been chosen for illustrative purposes only and does not represent a likely Initial Value. The hypothetical Coupon Barrier Value, Barrier Value, Physical Delivery Amount and Fractional Share Amount shown in the table above is based on such hypothetical Initial Value. The actual Initial Value, Coupon Barrier Value, Barrier Value, Physical Delivery Amount and Fractional Share Amount for the Reference Asset will be determined on the Initial Valuation Date. For information regarding recent values of the Reference Asset, please see “Information Regarding the Reference Asset” in this pricing supplement. Final Value Reference Asset Return Payment at Maturity** $220.00 50.00% $1,000.00 $210.00 40.00% $1,000.00 $195.00 30.00% $1,000.00 $180.00 20.00% $1,000.00 $165.00 10.00% $1,000.00 $150.00 0.00% $1,000.00 $135.00 -10.00% $1,000.00 $120.00 -20.00% $1,000.00 $105.00 -30.00% $1,000.00 $90.00 -40.00% $1,000.00 $75.00 -50.00% $1,000.00 $60.00 -60.00% $400.00 $45.00 -70.00% $300.00 $30.00 -80.00% $200.00 $15.00 -90.00% $100.00 $0.00 -100.00% $0.00 ** per $1,000 principal amount Note, excluding the final Contingent Coupon that may be payable on the Maturity Date, and assumes we do not elect to exercise our physical settlement option. For an example demonstrating the amount of shares and cash that you would receive if (a) the Final Value of the Reference Asset is less than the Barrier Value and (b) we elect to exercise our physical settlement option, please see the final example below. The following examples illustrate how the payments at maturity set forth in the table above are calculated: Example 1: The Final Value of the Reference Asset is $210.00. Because the Final Value of the Reference Asset is greater than or equal to the Barrier Value, you will receive a payment at maturity of $1,000 per $1,000 principal amount Note that you hold (plus the Contingent Coupon that will otherwise be payable on the Maturity Date). PS—11 Example 2: The Final Value of the Reference Asset is $90.00. Because the Final Value of the Reference Asset is greater than or equal to the Barrier Value, you will receive a payment at maturity of $1,000 per $1,000 principal amount Note that you hold (plus the Contingent Coupon that will otherwise be payable on the Maturity Date). Example 3: The Final Value of the Reference Asset is $60.00. Because the Final Value of the Reference Asset is less than the Barrier Value, if we do not elect to exercise our physical settlement option, you will receive a payment at maturity of $400.00 per $1,000 principal amount Note that you hold, calculated as follows: $1,000 + [$1,000 × Reference Asset Return of the Reference Asset] $1,000 + [$1,000 × -60.00%] = $400.00 In addition, because the Final Value of the Reference Asset is less than the Coupon Barrier Value, you will not receive a Contingent Coupon on the Maturity Date. The Applicable Physical Delivery Amount and the Applicable Fractional Share Amount are 6 shares and 0.66667 shares, respectively. Accordingly, if we do elect to exercise our physical settlement option, you will receive on the Maturity Date a total of 6 shares of Reference Asset plus $40.00 in cash. For the avoidance of doubt, if the actual Initial Value of the Reference Asset is greater than $1,000 and we do elect to exercise our physical settlement option, you will not receive any shares of the Reference Asset, rather you will only receive a cash payment on the Maturity Date equivalent to the Fractional Share Amount of the Reference Asset multiplied by its Final Value. Example 3 demonstrates that if the Notes are not redeemed prior to scheduled maturity, and if the Final Value is less than the Barrier Value, your investment in the Notes will be fully exposed to the decline of the Reference Asset from the Initial Value. If the Notes are not redeemed prior to scheduled maturity, you may lose up to 100.00% of the principal amount of your Notes. Any payment on the Notes, including the repayment of principal, is subject to the credit risk of Barclays Bank PLC. PS—12 SELECTED RISK CONSIDERATIONS An investment in the Notes involves significant risks. Investing in the Notes is not equivalent to investing directly in the Reference Asset or its components, if any. Some of the risks that apply to an investment in the Notes are summarized below, but we urge you to read the more detailed explanation of risks relating to the Notes generally in the “Risk Factors” section of the prospectus supplement. You should not purchase the Notes unless you understand and can bear the risks of investing in the Notes. Risks Relating to the Notes Generally ● Your Investment in the Notes May Result in a Significant Loss — The Notes differ from ordinary debt securities in that the Issuer will not necessarily repay the full principal amount of the Notes at maturity. If the Notes are not redeemed prior to scheduled maturity, and if the Final Value of the Reference Asset is less than the Barrier Value, your Notes will be fully exposed to the decline of the Reference Asset from the Initial Value. You may lose up to 100.00% of the principal amount of your Notes. ● The Notes Are Subject to Risks Associated with our Physical Settlement Option — As described on the cover of this pricing supplement, you may under certain circumstances receive shares of the Reference Asset at maturity. If we exercise our physical settlement option, the market value of the shares that you receive may be less than the amount of the cash payment that you would have received had we not exercised such option because of fluctuations in the value of the Reference Asset between the Final Valuation Date and the Maturity Date. ● Potential Return is Limited to the Contingent Coupons, If Any, and You Will Not Participate in Any Appreciation of The Reference Asset — The potential positive return on the Notes is limited to the Contingent Coupons, if any, that may be payable during the term of the Notes. You will not participate in any appreciation in the value of the Reference Asset, which may be significant, even though you will be exposed to the depreciation in the value of the Reference Asset if the Notes are not redeemed and the Final Value of the Reference Asset is less than the Barrier Value. ● You May Not Receive Any Contingent Coupon Payments on the Notes — The Issuer will not necessarily make periodic coupon payments on the Notes. You will receive a Contingent Coupon on a Contingent Coupon Payment Date only if the Closing Value of the Reference Asset on the related Observation Date is greater than or equal to the Coupon Barrier Value. If the Closing Value of the Reference Asset on an Observation Date is less than the Coupon Barrier Value, you will not receive a Contingent Coupon on the related Contingent Coupon Payment Date. If the Closing Value of the Reference Asset is less than the Coupon Barrier Value on each Observation Date, you will not receive any Contingent Coupons during the term of the Notes. ● The Notes Are Subject to Volatility Risk — Volatility is a measure of the degree of variation in the price of an asset (or level of an index) over a period of time. The amount of any coupon payments that may be payable under the Notes is based on a number of factors, including the expected volatility of the Reference Asset. The amount of such coupon payments will be paid at a per annum rate that is higher than the fixed rate that we would pay on a conventional debt security of the same tenor and is higher than it otherwise would have been had the expected volatility of the Reference Asset been lower. As volatility of the Reference Asset increases, there will typically be a greater likelihood that (a) the Closing Value of the Reference Asset on one or more Observation Dates will be less than the Coupon Barrier Value and (b) the Final Value of the Reference Asset will be less than the Barrier Value. Accordingly, you should understand that a higher coupon payment amount reflects, among other things, an indication of a greater likelihood that you will (a) not receive coupon payments with respect to one or more Observation Dates and/or (b) incur a loss of principal at maturity than would have been the case had the amount of such coupon payments been lower. In addition, actual volatility over the term of the Notes may be significantly higher than the expected volatility at the time the terms of the Notes were determined. If actual volatility is higher than expected, you will face an even greater risk that you will not receive coupon payments and/or that you will lose some or all of your principal at maturity for the reasons described above. ● Early Redemption and Reinvestment Risk — While the original term of the Notes is as indicated on the cover of this pricing supplement, the Notes may be redeemed prior to maturity, as described above, and the holding period over which you may receive any coupon payments that may be payable under the Notes could be as short as approximately six months. The Redemption Price that you would receive on a Call Settlement Date, together with any coupon payments that you may have received prior to the Call Settlement Date, may be less than the aggregate amount of payments that you would have received had the Notes not been redeemed. There is no guarantee that you would be able to reinvest the proceeds from an investment in the Notes in a comparable investment with a similar level of risk in the event the Notes are redeemed prior to the Maturity Date. No additional payments will be due after the relevant Call Settlement Date. The fact that the Notes may be redeemed prior to maturity may also adversely impact your ability to sell your Notes and the price at which they may be sold. ● Any Payment on the Notes Will Be Determined Based on the Closing Values of the Reference Asset on the Dates Specified — Any payment on the Notes will be determined based on the Closing Values of the Reference Asset on the dates specified. You will not benefit from any more favorable values of the Reference Asset determined at any other time. ● Contingent Repayment of Any Principal Amount Applies Only at Maturity or upon Any Redemption — You should be willing to hold your Notes to maturity or any redemption. Although the Notes provide for the contingent repayment of the principal amount of your Notes at maturity, provided that the Final Value of the Reference Asset is greater than or equal to the Barrier Value, or upon any redemption, if you sell your Notes prior to such time in the secondary market, if any, you may have PS—13 to sell your Notes at a price that is less than the principal amount even if at that time the value of the Reference Asset has increased from the Initial Value. See “Many Economic and Market Factors Will Impact the Value of the Notes” below. ● Owning the Notes is Not the Same as Owning a Reference Asset or Any Securities to which a Reference Asset Provides Exposure — The return on the Notes may not reflect the return you would realize if you actually owned a Reference Asset or any securities to which a Reference Asset provides exposure. As a holder of the Notes, you will not have voting rights or rights to receive dividends or other distributions or any other rights that holders of a Reference Asset or any securities to which a Reference Asset provides exposure may have. ● Tax Treatment — Significant aspects of the tax treatment of the Notes are uncertain. You should consult your tax advisor about your tax situation. See “Tax Considerations” below. Risks Relating to the Issuer ● Credit of Issuer — The Notes are unsecured and unsubordinated debt obligations of the Issuer, Barclays Bank PLC, and are not, either directly or indirectly, an obligation of any third party. Any payment to be made on the Notes, including any repayment of principal, is subject to the ability of Barclays Bank PLC to satisfy its obligations as they come due and is not guaranteed by any third party. As a result, the actual and perceived creditworthiness of Barclays Bank PLC may affect the market value of the Notes, and in the event Barclays Bank PLC were to default on its obligations, you may not receive any amounts owed to you under the terms of the Notes. ● You May Lose Some or All of Your Investment If Any U.K. Bail-in Power Is Exercised by the Relevant U.K. Resolution Authority — Notwithstanding and to the exclusion of any other term of the Notes or any other agreements, arrangements or understandings between Barclays Bank PLC and any holder or beneficial owner of the Notes (or the Trustee on behalf of the holders of the Notes), by acquiring the Notes, each holder and beneficial owner of the Notes acknowledges, accepts, agrees to be bound by, and consents to the exercise of, any U.K. Bail-in Power by the relevant U.K. resolution authority as set forth under “Consent to U.K. Bail-in Power” in this pricing supplement. Accordingly, any U.K. Bail-in Power may be exercised in such a manner as to result in you and other holders and beneficial owners of the Notes losing all or a part of the value of your investment in the Notes or receiving a different security from the Notes, which may be worth significantly less than the Notes and which may have significantly fewer protections than those typically afforded to debt securities. Moreover, the relevant U.K. resolution authority may exercise the U.K. Bail-in Power without providing any advance notice to, or requiring the consent of, the holders and beneficial owners of the Notes. The exercise of any U.K. Bail-in Power by the relevant U.K. resolution authority with respect to the Notes will not be a default or an Event of Default (as each term is defined in the senior debt securities indenture) and the trustee will not be liable for any action that the trustee takes, or abstains from taking, in either case, in accordance with the exercise of the U.K. Bail-in Power by the relevant U.K. resolution authority with respect to the Notes. See “Consent to U.K. Bail-in Power” in this pricing supplement as well as “U.K. Bail-in Power,” “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to the Securities Generally—Regulatory action in the event a bank or investment firm in the Group is failing or likely to fail, including the exercise by the relevant U.K. resolution authority of a variety of statutory resolution powers, could materially adversely affect the value of any securities” and “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to the Securities Generally—Under the terms of the securities, you have agreed to be bound by the exercise of any U.K. Bail-in Power by the relevant U.K. resolution authority” in the accompanying prospectus supplement. Risks Relating to the Reference Asset ● Historical Performance of the Reference Asset Should Not Be Taken as Any Indication of the Future Performance of the Reference Asset Over the Term of the Notes — The value of the Reference Asset has fluctuated in the past and may, in the future, experience significant fluctuations. The historical performance of the Reference Asset is not an indication of the future performance of the Reference Asset over the term of the Notes. Therefore, the performance of the Reference Asset over the term of the Notes may bear no relation or resemblance to the historical performance of the Reference Asset. ● Single Equity Risk — The value of the Reference Asset can rise or fall sharply due to factors specific to the Reference Asset, such as stock price volatility, earnings, financial conditions, corporate, industry and regulatory developments, management changes and decisions and other events, as well as general market factors, such as general stock market volatility and levels, interest rates and economic and political conditions. We urge you to review financial and other information filed periodically with the SEC by the Reference Asset. We have not undertaken any independent review or due diligence of the SEC filings of the Reference Asset or of any other publicly available information regarding the Reference Asset. ● Anti-Dilution Protection Is Limited, and the Calculation Agent Has Discretion to Make Anti-Dilution Adjustments — The Calculation Agent may in its sole discretion make adjustments affecting the amounts payable on the Notes upon the occurrence of certain corporate events (such as stock splits or extraordinary or special dividends) that the Calculation Agent determines have a diluting or concentrative effect on the theoretical value of the Reference Asset. However, the Calculation Agent might not make such adjustments in response to all events that could affect the Reference Asset. The occurrence of any such event and any adjustment made by the Calculation Agent (or a determination by the Calculation Agent not to make any adjustment) may adversely affect any amounts payable on the Notes. See “Reference Assets—Equity Securities—Share Adjustments Relating to Securities with an Equity Security as a Reference Asset” in the accompanying prospectus supplement. ● Reorganization Or Other Events Could Adversely Affect the Value of the Notes Or Result in the Notes Being Accelerated — Upon the occurrence of certain reorganization events or a nationalization, expropriation, liquidation, bankruptcy, insolvency or de-listing of the Reference Asset, the Calculation Agent will make adjustments to the Reference PS—14 Asset that may result in payments on the Notes being based on the performance of shares, cash or other assets distributed to holders of the Reference Asset upon the occurrence of such event or, in some cases, the Calculation Agent may accelerate the maturity date for a payment determined by the Calculation Agent. Any of these actions could adversely affect the value of the Reference Asset and, consequently, the value of the Notes. Any amount payable upon acceleration could be significantly less than the amount(s) that would be due on the Notes if they were not accelerated. See “Reference Assets—Equity Securities—Share Adjustments Relating to Securities with an Equity Security as a Reference Asset” in the accompanying prospectus supplement. Risks Relating to Conflicts of Interest ● We and Our Affiliates May Engage in Various Activities or Make Determinations That Could Materially Affect the Notes in Various Ways and Create Conflicts of Interest — We and our affiliates play a variety of roles in connection with the issuance of the Notes, as described below. In performing these roles, our and our affiliates’ economic interests are potentially adverse to your interests as an investor in the Notes. In connection with our normal business activities and in connection with hedging our obligations under the Notes, we and our affiliates make markets in and trade various financial instruments or products for our accounts and for the account of our clients and otherwise provide investment banking and other financial services with respect to these financial instruments and products. These financial instruments and products may include securities, derivative instruments or assets that may relate to the Reference Asset or its components, if any. In any such market making, trading and hedging activity, and other financial services, we or our affiliates may take positions or take actions that are inconsistent with, or adverse to, the investment objectives of the holders of the Notes. We and our affiliates have no obligation to take the needs of any buyer, seller or holder of the Notes into account in conducting these activities. Such market making, trading and hedging activity, investment banking and other financial services may negatively impact the value of the Notes. In addition, the role played by Barclays Capital Inc., as the agent for the Notes, could present significant conflicts of interest with the role of Barclays Bank PLC, as issuer of the Notes. For example, Barclays Capital Inc. or its representatives may derive compensation or financial benefit from the distribution of the Notes and such compensation or financial benefit may serve as incentive to sell the Notes instead of other investments. Furthermore, we and our affiliates establish the offering price of the Notes for initial sale to the public, and the offering price is not based upon any independent verification or valuation. In addition to the activities described above, we will also act as the Calculation Agent for the Notes. As Calculation Agent, we will determine any values of the Reference Asset and make any other determinations necessary to calculate any payments on the Notes. In making these determinations, the Calculation Agent may be required to make discretionary judgements relating to the Reference Asset, including determining whether a market disruption event has occurred or whether certain adjustments to the Reference Asset or other terms of the Notes are necessary, as further described in the accompanying prospectus supplement. In making these discretionary judgments, our economic interests are potentially adverse to your interests as an investor in the Notes, and any of these determinations may adversely affect any payments on the Notes. Risks Relating to the Estimated Value of the Notes and the Secondary Market ● The Estimated Value of Your Notes is Expected to be Lower Than the Initial Issue Price of Your Notes — The estimated value of your Notes on the Initial Valuation Date is expected to be lower, and may be significantly lower, than the initial issue price of your Notes. The difference between the initial issue price of your Notes and the estimated value of the Notes is a result of certain factors, such as any sales commissions to be paid to Barclays Capital Inc. or another affiliate of ours, any selling concessions, discounts, commissions or fees (including any structuring or other distribution related fees) to be allowed or paid to non-affiliated intermediaries, the estimated profit that we or any of our affiliates expect to earn in connection with structuring the Notes, the estimated cost which we may incur in hedging our obligations under the Notes, and estimated development and other costs which we may incur in connection with the Notes. ● The Estimated Value of Your Notes Might be Lower if Such Estimated Value Were Based on the Levels at Which Our Debt Securities Trade in the Secondary Market — The estimated value of your Notes on the Initial Valuation Date is based on a number of variables, including our internal funding rates. Our internal funding rates may vary from the levels at which our benchmark debt securities trade in the secondary market. As a result of this difference, the estimated value referenced above might be lower if such estimated value were based on the levels at which our benchmark debt securities trade in the secondary market. ● The Estimated Value of the Notes is Based on Our Internal Pricing Models, Which May Prove to be Inaccurate and May be Different from the Pricing Models of Other Financial Institutions — The estimated value of your Notes on the Initial Valuation Date is based on our internal pricing models, which take into account a number of variables and are based on a number of subjective assumptions, which may or may not materialize. These variables and assumptions are not evaluated or verified on an independent basis. Further, our pricing models may be different from other financial institutions’ pricing models and the methodologies used by us to estimate the value of the Notes may not be consistent with those of other financial institutions which may be purchasers or sellers of Notes in the secondary market. As a result, the secondary market price of your Notes may be materially different from the estimated value of the Notes determined by reference to our internal pricing models. PS—15 ● The Estimated Value of Your Notes Is Not a Prediction of the Prices at Which You May Sell Your Notes in the Secondary Market, if any, and Such Secondary Market Prices, If Any, Will Likely be Lower Than the Initial Issue Price of Your Notes and May be Lower Than the Estimated Value of Your Notes — The estimated value of the Notes will not be a prediction of the prices at which Barclays Capital Inc., other affiliates of ours or third parties may be willing to purchase the Notes from you in secondary market transactions (if they are willing to purchase, which they are not obligated to do). The price at which you may be able to sell your Notes in the secondary market at any time will be influenced by many factors that cannot be predicted, such as market conditions, and any bid and ask spread for similar sized trades, and may be substantially less than our estimated value of the Notes. Further, as secondary market prices of your Notes take into account the levels at which our debt securities trade in the secondary market, and do not take into account our various costs related to the Notes such as fees, commissions, discounts, and the costs of hedging our obligations under the Notes, secondary market prices of your Notes will likely be lower than the initial issue price of your Notes. As a result, the price at which Barclays Capital Inc., other affiliates of ours or third parties may be willing to purchase the Notes from you in secondary market transactions, if any, will likely be lower than the price you paid for your Notes, and any sale prior to the Maturity Date could result in a substantial loss to you. ● The Temporary Price at Which We May Initially Buy The Notes in the Secondary Market And the Value We May Initially Use for Customer Account Statements, If We Provide Any Customer Account Statements At All, May Not Be Indicative of Future Prices of Your Notes — Assuming that all relevant factors remain constant after the Initial Valuation Date, the price at which Barclays Capital Inc. may initially buy or sell the Notes in the secondary market (if Barclays Capital Inc. makes a market in the Notes, which it is not obligated to do) and the value that we may initially use for customer account statements, if we provide any customer account statements at all, may exceed our estimated value of the Notes on the Initial Valuation Date, as well as the secondary market value of the Notes, for a temporary period after the initial Issue Date of the Notes. The price at which Barclays Capital Inc. may initially buy or sell the Notes in the secondary market and the value that we may initially use for customer account statements may not be indicative of future prices of your Notes. ● Lack of Liquidity — The Notes will not be listed on any securities exchange. Barclays Capital Inc. and other affiliates of Barclays Bank PLC intend to make a secondary market for the Notes but are not required to do so, and may discontinue any such secondary market making at any time, without notice. Barclays Capital Inc. may at any time hold unsold inventory, which may inhibit the development of a secondary market for the Notes. Even if there is a secondary market, it may not provide enough liquidity to allow you to trade or sell the Notes easily. Because other dealers are not likely to make a secondary market for the Notes, the price at which you may be able to trade your Notes is likely to depend on the price, if any, at which Barclays Capital Inc. and other affiliates of Barclays Bank PLC are willing to buy the Notes. The Notes are not designed to be short-term trading instruments. Accordingly, you should be willing and able to hold your Notes to maturity. ● Many Economic and Market Factors Will Impact the Value of the Notes — The value of the Notes will be affected by a number of economic and market factors that interact in complex and unpredictable ways and that may either offset or magnify each other, including: o the market price of, dividend rate on and expected volatility of the Reference Asset or the components of the Reference Asset, if any; o the time to maturity of the Notes; o interest and yield rates in the market generally; o a variety of economic, financial, political, regulatory or judicial events; o supply and demand for the Notes; and o our creditworthiness, including actual or anticipated downgrades in our credit ratings. PS—16 INFORMATION REGARDING THE REFERENCE ASSET We urge you to read the following section in the accompanying prospectus supplement: “Reference Assets—Equity Securities—Reference Asset Issuer and Reference Asset Information.” Companies with securities registered under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, which is commonly referred to as the “Exchange Act,” and the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended, which is commonly referred to as the “’40 Act,” are required to periodically file certain financial and other information specified by the SEC. Information provided to or filed with the SEC electronically can be accessed through a website maintained by the SEC. The address of the SEC’s website is http://www.sec.gov. Information provided to or filed with the SEC pursuant to the Exchange Act or the ’40 Act by the company issuing the Reference Asset can be located by reference to the SEC file number specified below. The summary information below regarding the Reference Asset comes from the company’s SEC filings. You are urged to refer to the SEC filings made by the company and to other publicly available information (such as the company’s annual report) to obtain an understanding of the company’s business and financial prospects. The summary information contained below is not designed to be, and should not be interpreted as, an effort to present information regarding the financial prospects of any issuer or any trends, events or other factors that may have a positive or negative influence on those prospects or as an endorsement of any particular company. We have not undertaken any independent review or due diligence of the SEC filings of the issuer of the Reference Asset or of any other publicly available information regarding such issuer. Information from outside sources is not incorporated by reference in, and should not be considered part of, this pricing supplement or any accompanying prospectus or prospectus supplement. We have not undertaken any independent review or due diligence of the SEC filings of the Reference Asset or any other publicly available information regarding the Reference Asset. We obtained the historical trading price information with respect to the Reference Asset set forth below from Bloomberg Professional® service (“Bloomberg”). We have not independently verified the accuracy or completeness of the information obtained from Bloomberg.

Historical Performance of the Common Stock of U.S. Bancorp PAST PERFORMANCE IS NOT INDICATIVE OF FUTURE RESULTS PS—17 TAX CONSIDERATIONS You should review carefully the sections in the accompanying prospectus supplement entitled “Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences—Tax Consequences to U.S. Holders—Notes Treated as Prepaid Forward or Derivative Contracts with Associated Contingent Coupons” and, if you are a non-U.S. holder, “—Tax Consequences to Non-U.S. Holders.” The following discussion supersedes the discussion in the accompanying prospectus supplement to the extent it is inconsistent therewith. This discussion does not address the U.S. federal income tax consequences of the ownership or disposition of the Reference Asset that you may receive at maturity. You should consult your tax advisor regarding the potential U.S. federal tax consequences of the ownership and disposition of the Reference Asset. In determining our reporting responsibilities, if any, we intend to treat (i) the Notes for U.S. federal income tax purposes as prepaid forward contracts with associated contingent coupons and (ii) any Contingent Coupon payments as ordinary income, as described in the section entitled “Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences—Tax Consequences to U.S. Holders—Notes Treated as Prepaid Forward or Derivative Contracts with Associated Contingent Coupons” in the accompanying prospectus supplement. Our special tax counsel, Davis Polk & Wardwell LLP, has advised that it believes this treatment to be reasonable, but that there are other reasonable treatments that the Internal Revenue Service (the “IRS”) or a court may adopt. Sale, exchange or redemption of a Note. Assuming the treatment described above is respected, and except as described below, upon a sale or exchange of the Notes (including redemption for cash upon an automatic call or at maturity), you should recognize capital gain or loss equal to the difference between the amount realized on the sale or exchange and your tax basis in the Notes, which should equal the amount you paid to acquire the Notes (assuming Contingent Coupon payments are properly treated as ordinary income, consistent with the position referred to above). This gain or loss should be short-term capital gain or loss unless you hold the Notes for more than one year, in which case the gain or loss should be long-term capital gain or loss, whether or not you are an initial purchaser of the Notes at the issue price. The deductibility of capital losses is subject to limitations. If you sell your Notes between the time your right to a Contingent Coupon payment is fixed and the time it is paid, it is likely that you will be treated as receiving ordinary income equal to the Contingent Coupon payment. Although uncertain, it is possible that proceeds received from the sale or exchange of your Notes prior to an Observation Date but that can be attributed to an expected Contingent Coupon payment could be treated as ordinary income. You should consult your tax advisor regarding this issue. If you receive shares of the Reference Asset upon the maturity of your Notes, you should be deemed to have applied the purchase price of your Notes toward the purchase of the shares of the Reference Asset you receive. You should not recognize gain or loss with respect to the shares of the Reference Asset you receive. Instead, assuming Contingent Coupon payments are properly treated as ordinary income, consistent with the position described above, your basis in the shares (including any fractional share) should equal the price you paid to acquire your Notes, and that basis should be allocated proportionately among the shares. Your holding period for the Reference Asset should begin on the day after receipt. With respect to any cash received in lieu of a fractional share of the Reference Asset, you should recognize capital gain or loss in an amount equal to the difference between the amount of the cash received and the tax basis allocable to the fractional share. As noted above, there are other reasonable treatments that the IRS or a court may adopt, in which case the timing and character of any income or loss on the Notes could be materially affected. In addition, in 2007 the U.S. Treasury Department and the IRS released a notice requesting comments on the U.S. federal income tax treatment of “prepaid forward contracts” and similar instruments. The notice focuses in particular on whether to require investors in these instruments to accrue income over the term of their investment. It also asks for comments on a number of related topics, including the character of income or loss with respect to these instruments and the relevance of factors such as the nature of the underlying property to which the instruments are linked. While the notice requests comments on appropriate transition rules and effective dates, any Treasury regulations or other guidance promulgated after consideration of these issues could materially affect the tax consequences of an investment in the Notes, possibly with retroactive effect. You should consult your tax advisor regarding the U.S. federal income tax consequences of an investment in the Notes, including possible alternative treatments and the issues presented by this notice. Non-U.S. holders. Insofar as we have responsibility as a withholding agent, we do not currently intend to treat Contingent Coupon payments to non-U.S. holders (as defined in the accompanying prospectus supplement) as subject to U.S. withholding tax. However, non-U.S. holders should in any event expect to be required to provide appropriate Forms W-8 or other documentation in order to establish an exemption from backup withholding, as described under the heading “—Information Reporting and Backup Withholding” in the accompanying prospectus supplement. If any withholding is required, we will not be required to pay any additional amounts with respect to amounts withheld. Treasury regulations under Section 871(m) generally impose a withholding tax on certain “dividend equivalents” under certain “equity linked instruments.” A recent IRS notice excludes from the scope of Section 871(m) instruments issued prior to January 1, 2025 that do not have a “delta of one” with respect to underlying securities that could pay U.S.-source dividends for U.S. federal income tax purposes (each an “Underlying Security”). Based on our determination that the Notes do not have a “delta of one” within the meaning of the regulations, we expect that these regulations will not apply to the Notes with regard to non-U.S. holders. Our determination is not binding on the IRS, and the IRS may disagree with this determination. Section 871(m) is complex and its application may depend on your particular circumstances, including whether you enter into other transactions with respect to an Underlying Security. If necessary, further information regarding the potential application of Section 871(m) will be provided in the pricing supplement for the Notes. You should consult your tax advisor regarding the potential application of Section 871(m) to the Notes. PS—18 SUPPLEMENTAL PLAN OF DISTRIBUTION We will agree to sell to Barclays Capital Inc. (the “Agent”), and the Agent will agree to purchase from us, the principal amount of the Notes, and at the price, specified on the cover of this pricing supplement. The Agent will commit to take and pay for all of the Notes, if any are taken. PS—19\n"

PS—2 ADDITIONAL DOCUMENTS RELATED TO THE OFFERING OF THE NOTES You should read this pricing supplement together with the prospectus dated May 23, 2022 as supplemented by the documents listed below, relating to our Global Medium-Term Notes, Series A, of which these Notes are a part. This pricing supplement, together with the documents listed below, contains the terms of the Notes and supersedes all prior or contemporaneous oral statements as well as any other written materials including preliminary or indicative pricing terms, correspondence, trade ideas, structures for implementation, sample structures, brochures or other educational materials of ours. You should carefully consider, among other things, the matters set forth under “Risk Factors” in the prospectus supplement and “Selected Risk Considerations” in this pricing supplement, as the Notes involve risks not associated with conventional debt securities. We urge you to consult your investment, legal, tax, accounting and other advisors before you invest in the Notes. You may access these documents on the SEC website at www.sec.gov as follows (or if such address has changed, by reviewing our filings for the relevant date on the SEC website): ● Prospectus dated May 23, 2022: http://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/312070/000119312522157585/d337542df3asr.htm ● Prospectus Supplement dated June 27, 2022: http://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0000312070/000095010322011301/dp169388_424b2-prosupp.htm ● Underlying Supplement dated June 27, 2022: http://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0000312070/000095010322011304/dp169384_424b2-underl.htm Our SEC file number is 1—10257. As used in this pricing supplement, “we,” “us” or “our” refers to Barclays Bank PLC. PS—3 CONSENT TO U.K. BAIL-IN POWER Notwithstanding and to the exclusion of any other term of the Notes or any other agreements, arrangements or understandings between us and any holder or beneficial owner of the Notes (or the Trustee on behalf of the holders of the Notes), by acquiring the Notes, each holder and beneficial owner of the Notes acknowledges, accepts, agrees to be bound by, and consents to the exercise of, any U.K. Bail-in Power by the relevant U.K. resolution authority. Under the U.K. Banking Act 2009, as amended, the relevant U.K. resolution authority may exercise a U.K. Bail-in Power in circumstances in which the relevant U.K. resolution authority is satisfied that the resolution conditions are met. These conditions include that a U.K. bank or investment firm is failing or is likely to fail to satisfy the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 (the “FSMA”) threshold conditions for authorization to carry on certain regulated activities (within the meaning of section 55B FSMA) or, in the case of a U.K. banking group company that is a European Economic Area (“EEA”) or third country institution or investment firm, that the relevant EEA or third country relevant authority is satisfied that the resolution conditions are met in respect of that entity. The U.K. Bail-in Power includes any write-down, conversion, transfer, modification and/or suspension power, which allows for (i) the reduction or cancellation of all, or a portion, of the principal amount of, interest on, or any other amounts payable on, the Notes; (ii) the conversion of all, or a portion, of the principal amount of, interest on, or any other amounts payable on, the Notes into shares or other securities or other obligations of Barclays Bank PLC or another person (and the issue to, or conferral on, the holder or beneficial owner of the Notes such shares, securities or obligations); (iii) the cancellation of the Notes and/or (iv) the amendment or alteration of the maturity of the Notes, or amendment of the amount of interest or any other amounts due on the Notes, or the dates on which interest or any other amounts become payable, including by suspending payment for a temporary period; which U.K. Bail-in Power may be exercised by means of a variation of the terms of the Notes solely to give effect to the exercise by the relevant U.K. resolution authority of such U.K. Bail-in Power. Each holder and beneficial owner of the Notes further acknowledges and agrees that the rights of the holders or beneficial owners of the Notes are subject to, and will be varied, if necessary, solely to give effect to, the exercise of any U.K. Bail-in Power by the relevant U.K. resolution authority. For the avoidance of doubt, this consent and acknowledgment is not a waiver of any rights holders or beneficial owners of the Notes may have at law if and to the extent that any U.K. Bail-in Power is exercised by the relevant U.K. resolution authority in breach of laws applicable in England. For more information, please see “Selected Risk Considerations—Risks Relating to the Issuer—You May Lose Some or All of Your Investment If Any U.K. Bail-in Power Is Exercised by the Relevant U.K. Resolution Authority” in this pricing supplement as well as “U.K. Bail-in Power,” “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to the Securities Generally—Regulatory action in the event a bank or investment firm in the Group is failing or likely to fail, including the exercise by the relevant U.K. resolution authority of a variety of statutory resolution powers, could materially adversely affect the value of any securities” and “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to the Securities Generally—Under the terms of the securities, you have agreed to be bound by the exercise of any U.K. Bail-in Power by the relevant U.K. resolution authority” in the accompanying prospectus supplement. PS—4 ADDITIONAL INFORMATION REGARDING OUR ESTIMATED VALUE OF THE NOTES The range of the estimated values of the Notes referenced above may not correlate on a linear basis with the range of any other term of the Notes as may be set forth in this pricing supplement. We determined the size of such range based on prevailing market conditions, as well as the anticipated duration of the marketing period for the Notes. The final terms for the Notes will be determined on the date the Notes are initially priced for sale to the public, which we refer to as the Initial Valuation Date, based on prevailing market conditions on or prior to the Initial Valuation Date, and will be communicated to investors either orally or in a final pricing supplement. Our internal pricing models take into account a number of variables and are based on a number of subjective assumptions, which may or may not materialize, typically including volatility, interest rates, and our internal funding rates. Our internal funding rates (which are our internally published borrowing rates based on variables such as market benchmarks, our appetite for borrowing, and our existing obligations coming to maturity) may vary from the levels at which our benchmark debt securities trade in the secondary market. Our estimated value on the Initial Valuation Date is based on our internal funding rates. Our estimated value of the Notes may be lower if such valuation were based on the levels at which our benchmark debt securities trade in the secondary market. Our estimated value of the Notes on the Initial Valuation Date is expected to be less than the initial issue price of the Notes. The difference between the initial issue price of the Notes and our estimated value of the Notes is a result of several factors, including any sales commissions to be paid to Barclays Capital Inc. or another affiliate of ours, any selling concessions, discounts, commissions or fees (including any structuring or other distribution related fees) to be allowed or paid to non-affiliated intermediaries, the estimated profit that we or any of our affiliates expect to earn in connection with structuring the Notes, the estimated cost which we may incur in hedging our obligations under the Notes, and estimated development and other costs which we may incur in connection with the Notes. Our estimated value on the Initial Valuation Date is not a prediction of the price at which the Notes may trade in the secondary market, nor will it be the price at which Barclays Capital Inc. may buy or sell the Notes in the secondary market. Subject to normal market and funding conditions, Barclays Capital Inc. or another affiliate of ours intends to offer to purchase the Notes in the secondary market but it is not obligated to do so. Assuming that all relevant factors remain constant after the Initial Valuation Date, the price at which Barclays Capital Inc. may initially buy or sell the Notes in the secondary market, if any, and the value that we may initially use for customer account statements, if we provide any customer account statements at all, may exceed our estimated value on the Initial Valuation Date for a temporary period expected to be approximately three months after the Issue Date because, in our discretion, we may elect to effectively reimburse to investors a portion of the estimated cost of hedging our obligations under the Notes and other costs in connection with the Notes which we will no longer expect to incur over the term of the Notes. We made such discretionary election and determined this temporary reimbursement period on the basis of a number of factors, which may include the tenor of the Notes and/or any agreement we may have with the distributors of the Notes. The amount of our estimated costs which we effectively reimburse to investors in this way may not be allocated ratably throughout the reimbursement period, and we may discontinue such reimbursement at any time or revise the duration of the reimbursement period after the initial Issue Date of the Notes based on changes in market conditions and other factors that cannot be predicted. We urge you to read the “Selected Risk Considerations” beginning on page PS-12 of this pricing supplement. You may revoke your offer to purchase the Notes at any time prior to the Initial Valuation Date. We reserve the right to change the terms of, or reject any offer to purchase, the Notes prior to the Initial Valuation Date. In the event of any changes to the terms of the Notes, we will notify you and you will be asked to accept such changes in connection with your purchase. You may also choose to reject such changes in which case we may reject your offer to purchase. PS—5 SELECTED PURCHASE CONSIDERATIONS The Notes are not suitable for all investors. The Notes may be a suitable investment for you if all of the following statements are true: ● You do not seek an investment that produces fixed periodic interest or coupon payments or other non-contingent sources of current income, and you can tolerate receiving few or no Contingent Coupons over the term of the Notes in the event the Closing Value of any Reference Asset falls below its Coupon Barrier Value on one or more of the specified Observation Dates. ● You understand and accept that you will not participate in any appreciation of any Reference Asset, which may be significant, and that your return potential on the Notes is limited to the Contingent Coupons, if any, paid on the Notes. ● You can tolerate a loss of a significant portion or all of the principal amount of your Notes, and you are willing and able to make an investment that may have the full downside market risk of an investment in the Least Performing Reference Asset. ● You do not anticipate that the Closing Value of any Reference Asset will fall below its Coupon Barrier Value on any Observation Date or below its Barrier Value on the Final Valuation Date. ● You understand and accept that you will not be entitled to receive dividends or distributions that may be paid to holders of any Reference Asset or any securities to which any Reference Asset provides exposure, nor will you have any voting rights with respect to any Reference Asset or any securities to which any Reference Asset provides exposure. ● You are willing and able to accept the individual market risk of each Reference Asset and understand that any decline in the value of one Reference Asset will not be offset or mitigated by a lesser decline or any potential increase in the value of any other Reference Asset. ● You understand and accept the risks that (a) you will not receive a Contingent Coupon if the Closing Value of any Reference Asset is less than its Coupon Barrier Value on an Observation Date and (b) you will lose some or all of your principal at maturity if the Final Value of any Reference Asset is less than its Barrier Value. ● You understand and accept the risk that, if the Notes are not redeemed prior to scheduled maturity, the payment at maturity, if any, will be based solely on the Reference Asset Return of the Least Performing Reference Asset. ● You understand and are willing and able to accept the risks associated with an investment linked to the performance of the Reference Assets. ● You are willing and able to accept the risk that the Notes may be redeemed prior to scheduled maturity and that you may not be able to reinvest your money in an alternative investment with comparable risk and yield. ● You can tolerate fluctuations in the price of the Notes prior to scheduled maturity that may be similar to or exceed the downside fluctuations in the values of the Reference Assets. ● You do not seek an investment for which there will be an active secondary market, and you are willing and able to hold the Notes to maturity if the Notes are not redeemed. ● You are willing and able to assume our credit risk for all payments on the Notes. ● You are willing and able to consent to the exercise of any U.K. Bail-in Power by any relevant U.K. resolution authority. The Notes may not be a suitable investment for you if any of the following statements are true: ● You seek an investment that produces fixed periodic interest or coupon payments or other non-contingent sources of current income, and/or you cannot tolerate receiving few or no Contingent Coupons over the term of the Notes in the event the Closing Value of any Reference Asset falls below its Coupon Barrier Value on one or more of the specified Observation Dates. ● You seek an investment that participates in the full appreciation of any or all of the Reference Assets rather than an investment with a return that is limited to the Contingent Coupons, if any, paid on the Notes. ● You seek an investment that provides for the full repayment of principal at maturity, and/or you are unwilling or unable to accept the risk that you may lose some or all of the principal amount of the Notes in the event that the Final Value of the Least Performing Reference Asset falls below its Barrier Value. ● You anticipate that the Closing Value of at least one Reference Asset will decline during the term of the Notes such that the Closing Value of at least one Reference Asset will fall below its Coupon Barrier Value on one or more Observation Dates and/or the Final Value of at least one Reference Asset will fall below its Barrier Value. ● You are unwilling or unable to accept the individual market risk of each Reference Asset and/or do not understand that any decline in the value of one Reference Asset will not be offset or mitigated by a lesser decline or any potential increase in the value of any other Reference Asset. ● You do not understand and/or are unwilling or unable to accept the risks associated with an investment linked to the performance of the Reference Assets. ● You are unwilling or unable to accept the risk that the negative performance of only one Reference Asset may cause you to not receive Contingent Coupons and/or suffer a loss of principal at maturity, regardless of the performance of any other Reference Asset. ● You are unwilling or unable to accept the risk that the Notes may be redeemed prior to scheduled maturity. ● You seek an investment that entitles you to dividends or distributions on, or voting rights related to any Reference Asset or any securities to which any Reference Asset provides exposure. PS—6 ● You cannot tolerate fluctuations in the price of the Notes prior to scheduled maturity that may be similar to or exceed the downside fluctuations in the values of the Reference Assets. ● You seek an investment for which there will be an active secondary market, and/or you are unwilling or unable to hold the Notes to maturity if the Notes are not redeemed. ● You prefer the lower risk, and therefore accept the potentially lower returns, of fixed income investments with comparable maturities and credit ratings. ● You are unwilling or unable to assume our credit risk for all payments on the Notes. ● You are unwilling or unable to consent to the exercise of any U.K. Bail-in Power by any relevant U.K. resolution authority. You must rely on your own evaluation of the merits of an investment in the Notes. You should reach a decision whether to invest in the Notes after carefully considering, with your advisors, the suitability of the Notes in light of your investment objectives and the specific information set out in this pricing supplement and the documents referenced under “Additional Documents Related to the Offering of the Notes” in this pricing supplement. Neither the Issuer nor Barclays Capital Inc. makes any recommendation as to the suitability of the Notes for investment. PS—7 ADDITIONAL TERMS OF THE NOTES The Observation Dates (including the Final Valuation Date), the Contingent Coupon Payment Dates, any Call Settlement Date and the Maturity Date are subject to postponement in certain circumstances, as described under “Reference Assets—Indices—Market Disruption Events for Securities with an Index of Equity Securities as a Reference Asset,” “Reference Assets—Least or Best Performing Reference Asset—Scheduled Trading Days and Market Disruption Events for Securities Linked to the Reference Asset with the Lowest or Highest Return in a Group of Two or More Equity Securities, Exchange-Traded Funds and/or Indices of Equity Securities” and “Terms of the Notes—Payment Dates” in the accompanying prospectus supplement. In addition, the Reference Assets and the Notes are subject to adjustment by the Calculation Agent under certain circumstances, as described under “Reference Assets—Indices—Adjustments Relating to Securities with an Index as a Reference Asset” in the accompanying prospectus supplement. PS—8 HYPOTHETICAL EXAMPLES OF AMOUNTS PAYABLE ON A SINGLE CONTINGENT COUPON PAYMENT DATE The following examples demonstrate the circumstances under which you may receive a Contingent Coupon on a hypothetical Contingent Coupon Payment Date. The numbers appearing in these tables are purely hypothetical and are provided for illustrative purposes only. These examples do not take into account any tax consequences from investing in the Notes and make the following key assumptions: ■ Hypothetical Initial Value of each Reference Asset: 100.00* ■ Hypothetical Coupon Barrier Value for each Reference Asset: 70.00 (70.00% of the hypothetical Initial Value set forth above)* * The hypothetical Initial Value of 100.00 and the hypothetical Coupon Barrier Value of 70.00 for each Reference Asset have been chosen for illustrative purposes only. The actual Initial Value and Coupon Barrier Value for each Reference Asset are as set forth on the cover of this pricing supplement. Example 1: The Closing Value of each Reference Asset is greater than its Coupon Barrier Value on the relevant Observation Date. Reference Asset Closing Value on Relevant Observation Date SPX Index 100.00 RTY Index 75.00 NDX Index 80.00 Because the Closing Value of each Reference Asset is greater than its respective Coupon Barrier Value, you will receive a Contingent Coupon of $9.875 (0.9875% of the principal amount per Note) on the related Contingent Coupon Payment Date. Example 2: The Closing Value of one Reference Asset is greater than its Coupon Barrier Value on the relevant Observation Date and the Closing Value of at least one Reference Asset is less than its Coupon Barrier Value on the relevant Observation Date. Reference Asset Closing Value on Relevant Observation Date SPX Index 80.00 RTY Index 69.00 NDX Index 50.00 Because the Closing Value of at least one Reference Asset is less than its Coupon Barrier Value, you will not receive a Contingent Coupon on the related Contingent Coupon Payment Date. Example 3: The Closing Value of each Reference Asset is less than its Coupon Barrier Value on the relevant Observation Date. Reference Asset Closing Value on Relevant Observation Date SPX Index 68.00 RTY Index 50.00 NDX Index 45.00 Because the Closing Value of at least one Reference Asset is less than its Coupon Barrier Value, you will not receive a Contingent Coupon on the related Contingent Coupon Payment Date. Examples 2 and 3 demonstrate that you may not receive a Contingent Coupon on a Contingent Coupon Payment Date. If the Closing Value of any Reference Asset is below its Coupon Barrier Value on each Observation Date, you will not receive any Contingent Coupons during the term of the Notes. PS—9 HYPOTHETICAL EXAMPLES OF AMOUNTS PAYABLE AT MATURITY The following table illustrates the hypothetical payment at maturity under various circumstances. The examples set forth below are purely hypothetical and are provided for illustrative purposes only. The numbers appearing in the following table and examples have been rounded for ease of analysis. The hypothetical examples below do not take into account any tax consequences from investing in the Notes and make the following key assumptions: ■ Hypothetical Initial Value of each Reference Asset: 100.00* ■ Hypothetical Coupon Barrier Value for each Reference Asset: 70.00 (70.00% of the hypothetical Initial Value set forth above)* ■ Hypothetical Barrier Value for each Reference Asset: 70.00 (70.00% of the hypothetical Initial Value set forth above)* ■ You hold the Notes to maturity, and the Notes are NOT redeemed prior to scheduled maturity. * The hypothetical Initial Value of 100.00, the hypothetical Coupon Barrier Value of 70.00 and the hypothetical Barrier Value of 70.00 for each Reference Asset have been chosen for illustrative purposes only. The actual Initial Value, Coupon Barrier Value and Barrier Value for each Reference Asset are as set forth on the cover of this pricing supplement.

The following examples illustrate how the payments at maturity set forth in the table above are calculated: Example 1: The Final Value of Reference Asset A is 135.00, the Final Value of Reference Asset B is 130.00 and the Final Value of Reference Asset C is 140.00. Because Reference Asset B has the lowest Reference Asset Return, Reference Asset B is the Least Performing Reference Asset. Because the Final Value of the Least Performing Reference Asset is greater than or equal to its Barrier Value, you will receive a payment at maturity of $1,000 per $1,000 principal amount Note that you hold (plus the Contingent Coupon that will otherwise be payable on the Maturity Date). PS—10 Example 2: The Final Value of Reference Asset A is 140.00, the Final Value of Reference Asset B is 90.00 and the Final Value of Reference Asset C is 105.00. Because Reference Asset B has the lowest Reference Asset Return, Reference Asset B is the Least Performing Reference Asset. Because the Final Value of the Least Performing Reference Asset is greater than or equal to its Barrier Value, you will receive a payment at maturity of $1,000 per $1,000 principal amount Note that you hold (plus the Contingent Coupon that will otherwise be payable on the Maturity Date). Example 3: The Final Value of Reference Asset A is 60.00, the Final Value of Reference Asset B is 120.00 and the Final Value of Reference Asset C is 100.00. Because Reference Asset A has the lowest Reference Asset Return, Reference Asset A is the Least Performing Reference Asset. Because the Final Value of the Least Performing Reference Asset is less than its Barrier Value, you will receive a payment at maturity of $600.00 per $1,000 principal amount Note that you hold, calculated as follows: $1,000 + [$1,000 × Reference Asset Return of the Least Performing Reference Asset] $1,000 + [$1,000 × -40.00%] = $600.00 In addition, because the Final Value of at least one Reference Asset is less than its Coupon Barrier Value, you will not receive a Contingent Coupon on the Maturity Date. Example 3 demonstrates that if the Notes are not redeemed prior to scheduled maturity, and if the Final Value of the Least Performing Reference Asset is less than its Barrier Value, your investment in the Notes will be fully exposed to the decline of the Least Performing Reference Asset from its Initial Value. You will not benefit in any way from the Reference Asset Return of any other Reference Asset being higher than the Reference Asset Return of the Least Performing Reference Asset. If the Notes are not redeemed prior to scheduled maturity, you may lose up to 100.00% of the principal amount of your Notes. Any payment on the Notes, including the repayment of principal, is subject to the credit risk of Barclays Bank PLC. PS—11 SELECTED RISK CONSIDERATIONS An investment in the Notes involves significant risks. Investing in the Notes is not equivalent to investing directly in the Reference Assets or their components, if any. Some of the risks that apply to an investment in the Notes are summarized below, but we urge you to read the more detailed explanation of risks relating to the Notes generally in the “Risk Factors” section of the prospectus supplement. You should not purchase the Notes unless you understand and can bear the risks of investing in the Notes. Risks Relating to the Notes Generally ● Your Investment in the Notes May Result in a Significant Loss — The Notes differ from ordinary debt securities in that the Issuer will not necessarily repay the full principal amount of the Notes at maturity. If the Notes are not redeemed prior to scheduled maturity, and if the Final Value of the Least Performing Reference Asset is less than its Barrier Value, your Notes will be fully exposed to the decline of the Least Performing Reference Asset from its Initial Value. You may lose up to 100.00% of the principal amount of your Notes. ● Potential Return is Limited to the Contingent Coupons, If Any, and You Will Not Participate in Any Appreciation of Any Reference Asset — The potential positive return on the Notes is limited to the Contingent Coupons, if any, that may be payable during the term of the Notes. You will not participate in any appreciation in the value of any Reference Asset, which may be significant, even though you will be exposed to the depreciation in the value of the Least Performing Reference Asset if the Notes are not redeemed and the Final Value of the Least Performing Reference Asset is less than its Barrier Value. ● You May Not Receive Any Contingent Coupon Payments on the Notes — The Issuer will not necessarily make periodic coupon payments on the Notes. You will receive a Contingent Coupon on a Contingent Coupon Payment Date only if the Closing Value of each Reference Asset on the related Observation Date is greater than or equal to its respective Coupon Barrier Value. If the Closing Value of any Reference Asset on an Observation Date is less than its Coupon Barrier Value, you will not receive a Contingent Coupon on the related Contingent Coupon Payment Date. If the Closing Value of at least one Reference Asset is less than its respective Coupon Barrier Value on each Observation Date, you will not receive any Contingent Coupons during the term of the Notes. ● Because the Notes Are Linked to the Least Performing Reference Asset, You Are Exposed to Greater Risks of No Contingent Coupons and Sustaining a Significant Loss of Principal at Maturity Than If the Notes Were Linked to a Single Reference Asset — The risk that you will not receive any Contingent Coupons and lose a significant portion or all of your principal amount in the Notes at maturity is greater if you invest in the Notes as opposed to substantially similar securities that are linked to the performance of a single Reference Asset. With multiple Reference Assets, it is more likely that the Closing Value of at least one Reference Asset will be less than its Coupon Barrier Value on the specified Observation Dates or less than its Barrier Value on the Final Valuation Date, and therefore, it is more likely that you will not receive any Contingent Coupons and that you will suffer a significant loss of principal at maturity. Further, the performance of the Reference Assets may not be correlated or may be negatively correlated. The lower the correlation between multiple Reference Assets, the greater the potential for one of those Reference Assets to close below its Coupon Barrier Value or Barrier Value on an Observation Date or the Final Valuation Date, respectively. It is impossible to predict what the correlation among the Reference Assets will be over the term of the Notes. The Reference Assets represent different equity markets. These different equity markets may not perform similarly over the term of the Notes. Although the correlation of the Reference Assets’ performance may change over the term of the Notes, the Contingent Coupon rate is determined, in part, based on the correlation of the Reference Assets’ performance calculated using our internal models at the time when the terms of the Notes are finalized. A higher Contingent Coupon is generally associated with lower correlation of the Reference Assets, which reflects a greater potential for missed Contingent Coupons and for a loss of principal at maturity. ● You Are Exposed to the Market Risk of Each Reference Asset — Your return on the Notes is not linked to a basket consisting of the Reference Assets. Rather, it will be contingent upon the independent performance of each Reference Asset. Unlike an instrument with a return linked to a basket of underlying assets in which risk is mitigated and diversified among all the components of the basket, you will be exposed to the risks related to each Reference Asset. Poor performance by any Reference Asset over the term of the Notes may negatively affect your return and will not be offset or mitigated by any increases or lesser declines in the value of any other Reference Asset. To receive a Contingent Coupon, the Closing Value of each Reference Asset must be greater than or equal to its Coupon Barrier Value on the applicable Observation Date. In addition, if the Notes have not been redeemed prior to scheduled maturity, and if the Final Value of any Reference Asset is less than its Barrier Value, you will be exposed to the full decline in the Least Performing Reference Asset from its Initial Value. Accordingly, your investment is subject to the market risk of each Reference Asset. ● The Notes Are Subject to Volatility Risk — Volatility is a measure of the degree of variation in the price of an asset (or level of an index) over a period of time. The amount of any coupon payments that may be payable under the Notes is based on a number of factors, including the expected volatility of the Reference Assets. The amount of such coupon payments will be paid at a per annum rate that is higher than the fixed rate that we would pay on a conventional debt security of the same tenor and is higher than it otherwise would have been had the expected volatility of the Reference Assets been lower. As volatility of a Reference Asset increases, there will typically be a greater likelihood that (a) the Closing Value of that Reference Asset on one or more Observation Dates will be less than its Coupon Barrier Value and (b) the Final Value of that Reference Asset will be less than its Barrier Value. PS—12 Accordingly, you should understand that a higher coupon payment amount reflects, among other things, an indication of a greater likelihood that you will (a) not receive coupon payments with respect to one or more Observation Dates and/or (b) incur a loss of principal at maturity than would have been the case had the amount of such coupon payments been lower. In addition, actual volatility over the term of the Notes may be significantly higher than the expected volatility at the time the terms of the Notes were determined. If actual volatility is higher than expected, you will face an even greater risk that you will not receive coupon payments and/or that you will lose some or all of your principal at maturity for the reasons described above. ● Early Redemption and Reinvestment Risk — While the original term of the Notes is as indicated on the cover of this pricing supplement, the Notes may be redeemed prior to maturity, as described above, and the holding period over which you may receive any coupon payments that may be payable under the Notes could be as short as approximately three months. The Redemption Price that you would receive on a Call Settlement Date, together with any coupon payments that you may have received prior to the Call Settlement Date, may be less than the aggregate amount of payments that you would have received had the Notes not been redeemed. There is no guarantee that you would be able to reinvest the proceeds from an investment in the Notes in a comparable investment with a similar level of risk in the event the Notes are redeemed prior to the Maturity Date. No additional payments will be due after the relevant Call Settlement Date. The fact that the Notes may be redeemed prior to maturity may also adversely impact your ability to sell your Notes and the price at which they may be sold. It is more likely that we will redeem the Notes at our sole discretion prior to maturity to the extent that the expected interest payable on the Notes is greater than the interest that would be payable on other instruments issued by us of comparable maturity, terms and credit rating trading in the market. We are less likely to redeem the Notes prior to maturity when the expected interest payable on the Notes is less than the interest that would be payable on other comparable instruments issued by us, which includes when the value of any Reference Asset is less than its Coupon Barrier Value. Therefore, the Notes are more likely to remain outstanding when the expected interest payable on the Notes is less than what would be payable on other comparable instruments and when your risk of not receiving a Contingent Coupon is relatively higher. ● Any Payment on the Notes Will Be Determined Based on the Closing Values of the Reference Assets on the Dates Specified — Any payment on the Notes will be determined based on the Closing Values of the Reference Assets on the dates specified. You will not benefit from any more favorable values of the Reference Assets determined at any other time. ● Contingent Repayment of Any Principal Amount Applies Only at Maturity or upon Any Redemption — You should be willing to hold your Notes to maturity or any redemption. Although the Notes provide for the contingent repayment of the principal amount of your Notes at maturity, provided that the Final Value of the Least Performing Reference Asset is greater than or equal to its Barrier Value, or upon any redemption, if you sell your Notes prior to such time in the secondary market, if any, you may have to sell your Notes at a price that is less than the principal amount even if at that time the value of each Reference Asset has increased from its Initial Value. See “Many Economic and Market Factors Will Impact the Value of the Notes” below. ● Owning the Notes is Not the Same as Owning Any Reference Asset or Any Securities to which Any Reference Asset Provides Exposure — The return on the Notes may not reflect the return you would realize if you actually owned any Reference Asset or any securities to which any Reference Asset provides exposure. As a holder of the Notes, you will not have voting rights or rights to receive dividends or other distributions or any other rights that holders of any Reference Asset or any securities to which any Reference Asset provides exposure may have. ● Tax Treatment — Significant aspects of the tax treatment of the Notes are uncertain. You should consult your tax advisor about your tax situation. See “Tax Considerations” below. Risks Relating to the Issuer ● Credit of Issuer — The Notes are unsecured and unsubordinated debt obligations of the Issuer, Barclays Bank PLC, and are not, either directly or indirectly, an obligation of any third party. Any payment to be made on the Notes, including any repayment of principal, is subject to the ability of Barclays Bank PLC to satisfy its obligations as they come due and is not guaranteed by any third party. As a result, the actual and perceived creditworthiness of Barclays Bank PLC may affect the market value of the Notes, and in the event Barclays Bank PLC were to default on its obligations, you may not receive any amounts owed to you under the terms of the Notes. ● You May Lose Some or All of Your Investment If Any U.K. Bail-in Power Is Exercised by the Relevant U.K. Resolution Authority — Notwithstanding and to the exclusion of any other term of the Notes or any other agreements, arrangements or understandings between Barclays Bank PLC and any holder or beneficial owner of the Notes (or the Trustee on behalf of the holders of the Notes), by acquiring the Notes, each holder and beneficial owner of the Notes acknowledges, accepts, agrees to be bound by, and consents to the exercise of, any U.K. Bail-in Power by the relevant U.K. resolution authority as set forth under “Consent to U.K. Bail-in Power” in this pricing supplement. Accordingly, any U.K. Bail-in Power may be exercised in such a manner as to result in you and other holders and beneficial owners of the Notes losing all or a part of the value of your investment in the Notes or receiving a different security from the Notes, which may be worth significantly less than the Notes and which may have significantly fewer protections than those typically afforded to debt securities. Moreover, the relevant U.K. resolution authority may exercise the U.K. Bail-in Power without providing any advance notice to, or requiring the consent of, the holders and beneficial owners of the Notes. The exercise of any U.K. Bail-in Power by the relevant U.K. resolution authority with respect to the Notes will not be a default or an Event of Default (as each term is defined in the senior debt securities indenture) and the trustee will not be liable for any action that the trustee takes, or abstains from taking, in either PS—13 case, in accordance with the exercise of the U.K. Bail-in Power by the relevant U.K. resolution authority with respect to the Notes. See “Consent to U.K. Bail-in Power” in this pricing supplement as well as “U.K. Bail-in Power,” “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to the Securities Generally—Regulatory action in the event a bank or investment firm in the Group is failing or likely to fail, including the exercise by the relevant U.K. resolution authority of a variety of statutory resolution powers, could materially adversely affect the value of any securities” and “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to the Securities Generally—Under the terms of the securities, you have agreed to be bound by the exercise of any U.K. Bail-in Power by the relevant U.K. resolution authority” in the accompanying prospectus supplement. Risks Relating to the Reference Assets ● Historical Performance of the Reference Assets Should Not Be Taken as Any Indication of the Future Performance of the Reference Assets Over the Term of the Notes — The value of each Reference Asset has fluctuated in the past and may, in the future, experience significant fluctuations. The historical performance of a Reference Asset is not an indication of the future performance of that Reference Asset over the term of the Notes. The historical correlation among the Reference Assets is not an indication of the future correlation among them over the term of the Notes. Therefore, the performance of the Reference Assets individually or in comparison to each other over the term of the Notes may bear no relation or resemblance to the historical performance of any Reference Asset. ● Each Reference Asset Reflects the Price Return of the Securities Composing that Reference Asset, Not the Total Return — The return on the Notes is based on the performance of the Reference Assets, which reflects changes in the market prices of the securities composing the Reference Assets. The Reference Assets are not \"total return\" indices that, in addition to reflecting those price returns, would also reflect dividends paid on the securities composing that Reference Asset. Accordingly, the return on the Notes will not include such a total return feature. ● Adjustments to Any Reference Asset Could Adversely Affect the Value of the Notes — The sponsor of any Reference Asset may add, delete, substitute or adjust the securities composing that Reference Asset or make other methodological changes to that Reference Asset that could affect its value. The Calculation Agent will calculate the value to be used as the Closing Value of that Reference Asset in the event of certain material changes in or modifications to that Reference Asset. In addition, the sponsor of any Reference Asset may also discontinue or suspend calculation or publication of that Reference Asset at any time. Under these circumstances, the Calculation Agent may select a successor index that the Calculation Agent determines to be comparable to that Reference Asset or, if no successor index is available, the Calculation Agent will determine the value to be used as the Closing Value of that Reference Asset. Any of these actions could adversely affect the value of any Reference Asset and, consequently, the value of the Notes. See “Reference Assets—Indices—Adjustments Relating to Securities with an Index as a Reference Asset” in the accompanying prospectus supplement. ● The Notes Are Subject to Risks Associated with Non-U.S. Securities Markets — Certain component securities of the NDX Index are issued by non-U.S. companies in non-U.S. securities markets. Investments in securities linked to the value of such non-U.S. equity securities, such as the Notes, involve risks associated with the securities markets in the home countries of the issuers of those non-U.S. equity securities, including risks of volatility in those markets, governmental intervention in those markets and cross shareholdings in companies in certain countries. Also, there is generally less publicly available information about companies in some of these jurisdictions than there is about U.S. companies that are subject to the reporting requirements of the SEC, and generally non-U.S. companies are subject to accounting, auditing and financial reporting standards and requirements and securities trading rules different from those applicable to U.S. reporting companies. The prices of securities in non-U.S. markets may be affected by political, economic, financial and social factors in those countries, or global regions, including changes in government, economic and fiscal policies and currency exchange laws. ● The Notes Are Subject to Risks Associated with Small Capitalization Stocks — The RTY Index tracks companies that are considered small-capitalization companies. These companies often have greater stock price volatility, lower trading volume and less liquidity than large-capitalization companies, and therefore securities linked to the RTY Index may be more volatile than an investment linked to an index with component stocks issued by large-capitalization companies. Stock prices of small-capitalization companies are also more vulnerable than those of large-capitalization companies to adverse business and economic developments. In addition, small-capitalization companies are typically less stable financially than large-capitalization companies and may depend on a small number of key personnel, making them more vulnerable to loss of personnel. Small-capitalization companies are often subject to less analyst coverage and may be in early, and less predictable, periods of their corporate existences. Such companies tend to have smaller revenues, less diverse product lines, smaller shares of their product or service markets, fewer financial resources and less competitive strengths than large-capitalization companies and are more susceptible to adverse developments related to their products. Risks Relating to Conflicts of Interest ● We and Our Affiliates May Engage in Various Activities or Make Determinations That Could Materially Affect the Notes in Various Ways and Create Conflicts of Interest — We and our affiliates play a variety of roles in connection with the issuance of the Notes, as described below. In performing these roles, our and our affiliates’ economic interests are potentially adverse to your interests as an investor in the Notes. In connection with our normal business activities and in connection with hedging our obligations under the Notes, we and our affiliates make markets in and trade various financial instruments or products for our accounts and for the account of our clients and otherwise provide investment banking and other financial services with respect to these financial instruments and products. PS—14 These financial instruments and products may include securities, derivative instruments or assets that may relate to the Reference Assets or their components, if any. In any such market making, trading and hedging activity, and other financial services, we or our affiliates may take positions or take actions that are inconsistent with, or adverse to, the investment objectives of the holders of the Notes. We and our affiliates have no obligation to take the needs of any buyer, seller or holder of the Notes into account in conducting these activities. Such market making, trading and hedging activity, investment banking and other financial services may negatively impact the value of the Notes. In addition, the role played by Barclays Capital Inc., as the agent for the Notes, could present significant conflicts of interest with the role of Barclays Bank PLC, as issuer of the Notes. For example, Barclays Capital Inc. or its representatives may derive compensation or financial benefit from the distribution of the Notes and such compensation or financial benefit may serve as incentive to sell the Notes instead of other investments. Furthermore, we and our affiliates establish the offering price of the Notes for initial sale to the public, and the offering price is not based upon any independent verification or valuation. In addition to the activities described above, we will also act as the Calculation Agent for the Notes. As Calculation Agent, we will determine any values of the Reference Assets and make any other determinations necessary to calculate any payments on the Notes. In making these determinations, the Calculation Agent may be required to make discretionary judgements relating to the Reference Assets, including determining whether a market disruption event has occurred or whether certain adjustments to the Reference Assets or other terms of the Notes are necessary, as further described in the accompanying prospectus supplement. In making these discretionary judgments, our economic interests are potentially adverse to your interests as an investor in the Notes, and any of these determinations may adversely affect any payments on the Notes. Risks Relating to the Estimated Value of the Notes and the Secondary Market ● The Estimated Value of Your Notes is Expected to be Lower Than the Initial Issue Price of Your Notes — The estimated value of your Notes on the Initial Valuation Date is expected to be lower, and may be significantly lower, than the initial issue price of your Notes. The difference between the initial issue price of your Notes and the estimated value of the Notes is a result of certain factors, such as any sales commissions to be paid to Barclays Capital Inc. or another affiliate of ours, any selling concessions, discounts, commissions or fees (including any structuring or other distribution related fees) to be allowed or paid to non-affiliated intermediaries, the estimated profit that we or any of our affiliates expect to earn in connection with structuring the Notes, the estimated cost which we may incur in hedging our obligations under the Notes, and estimated development and other costs which we may incur in connection with the Notes. ● The Estimated Value of Your Notes Might be Lower if Such Estimated Value Were Based on the Levels at Which Our Debt Securities Trade in the Secondary Market — The estimated value of your Notes on the Initial Valuation Date is based on a number of variables, including our internal funding rates. Our internal funding rates may vary from the levels at which our benchmark debt securities trade in the secondary market. As a result of this difference, the estimated value referenced above might be lower if such estimated value were based on the levels at which our benchmark debt securities trade in the secondary market. ● The Estimated Value of the Notes is Based on Our Internal Pricing Models, Which May Prove to be Inaccurate and May be Different from the Pricing Models of Other Financial Institutions — The estimated value of your Notes on the Initial Valuation Date is based on our internal pricing models, which take into account a number of variables and are based on a number of subjective assumptions, which may or may not materialize. These variables and assumptions are not evaluated or verified on an independent basis. Further, our pricing models may be different from other financial institutions’ pricing models and the methodologies used by us to estimate the value of the Notes may not be consistent with those of other financial institutions which may be purchasers or sellers of Notes in the secondary market. As a result, the secondary market price of your Notes may be materially different from the estimated value of the Notes determined by reference to our internal pricing models. ● The Estimated Value of Your Notes Is Not a Prediction of the Prices at Which You May Sell Your Notes in the Secondary Market, if any, and Such Secondary Market Prices, If Any, Will Likely be Lower Than the Initial Issue Price of Your Notes and May be Lower Than the Estimated Value of Your Notes — The estimated value of the Notes will not be a prediction of the prices at which Barclays Capital Inc., other affiliates of ours or third parties may be willing to purchase the Notes from you in secondary market transactions (if they are willing to purchase, which they are not obligated to do). The price at which you may be able to sell your Notes in the secondary market at any time will be influenced by many factors that cannot be predicted, such as market conditions, and any bid and ask spread for similar sized trades, and may be substantially less than our estimated value of the Notes. Further, as secondary market prices of your Notes take into account the levels at which our debt securities trade in the secondary market, and do not take into account our various costs related to the Notes such as fees, commissions, discounts, and the costs of hedging our obligations under the Notes, secondary market prices of your Notes will likely be lower than the initial issue price of your Notes. As a result, the price at which Barclays Capital Inc., other affiliates of ours or third parties may be willing to purchase the Notes from you in secondary market transactions, if any, will likely be lower than the price you paid for your Notes, and any sale prior to the Maturity Date could result in a substantial loss to you. ● The Temporary Price at Which We May Initially Buy The Notes in the Secondary Market And the Value We May Initially Use for Customer Account Statements, If We Provide Any Customer Account Statements At All, May Not Be Indicative of Future Prices of Your Notes — Assuming that all relevant factors remain constant after the Initial Valuation Date, the price at which Barclays Capital Inc. may initially buy or sell the Notes in the secondary market (if Barclays Capital Inc. makes a market in the Notes, which it is not obligated to do) and the value that we may initially use for customer account PS—15 statements, if we provide any customer account statements at all, may exceed our estimated value of the Notes on the Initial Valuation Date, as well as the secondary market value of the Notes, for a temporary period after the initial Issue Date of the Notes. The price at which Barclays Capital Inc. may initially buy or sell the Notes in the secondary market and the value that we may initially use for customer account statements may not be indicative of future prices of your Notes. ● Lack of Liquidity — The Notes will not be listed on any securities exchange. Barclays Capital Inc. and other affiliates of Barclays Bank PLC intend to make a secondary market for the Notes but are not required to do so, and may discontinue any such secondary market making at any time, without notice. Barclays Capital Inc. may at any time hold unsold inventory, which may inhibit the development of a secondary market for the Notes. Even if there is a secondary market, it may not provide enough liquidity to allow you to trade or sell the Notes easily. Because other dealers are not likely to make a secondary market for the Notes, the price at which you may be able to trade your Notes is likely to depend on the price, if any, at which Barclays Capital Inc. and other affiliates of Barclays Bank PLC are willing to buy the Notes. The Notes are not designed to be short-term trading instruments. Accordingly, you should be willing and able to hold your Notes to maturity. ● Many Economic and Market Factors Will Impact the Value of the Notes — The value of the Notes will be affected by a number of economic and market factors that interact in complex and unpredictable ways and that may either offset or magnify each other, including: o the market price of, dividend rate on and expected volatility of the Reference Assets or the components of the Reference Assets, if any; o correlation (or lack of correlation) of the Reference Assets; o the time to maturity of the Notes; o interest and yield rates in the market generally; o a variety of economic, financial, political, regulatory or judicial events; o supply and demand for the Notes; and o our creditworthiness, including actual or anticipated downgrades in our credit ratings.

Historical Performance of the Nasdaq-100 Index® PAST PERFORMANCE IS NOT INDICATIVE OF FUTURE RESULTS PS—19 TAX CONSIDERATIONS You should review carefully the sections in the accompanying prospectus supplement entitled “Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences—Tax Consequences to U.S. Holders—Notes Treated as Prepaid Forward or Derivative Contracts with Associated Contingent Coupons” and, if you are a non-U.S. holder, “—Tax Consequences to Non-U.S. Holders.” The following discussion supersedes the discussion in the accompanying prospectus supplement to the extent it is inconsistent therewith. In determining our reporting responsibilities, if any, we intend to treat (i) the Notes for U.S. federal income tax purposes as prepaid forward contracts with associated contingent coupons and (ii) any Contingent Coupon payments as ordinary income, as described in the section entitled “Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences—Tax Consequences to U.S. Holders—Notes Treated as Prepaid Forward or Derivative Contracts with Associated Contingent Coupons” in the accompanying prospectus supplement. Our special tax counsel, Davis Polk & Wardwell LLP, has advised that it believes this treatment to be reasonable, but that there are other reasonable treatments that the Internal Revenue Service (the “IRS”) or a court may adopt. Sale, exchange or redemption of a Note. Assuming the treatment described above is respected, upon a sale or exchange of the Notes (including upon early redemption or redemption at maturity), you should recognize capital gain or loss equal to the difference between the amount realized on the sale or exchange and your tax basis in the Notes, which should equal the amount you paid to acquire the Notes (assuming Contingent Coupon payments are properly treated as ordinary income, consistent with the position referred to above). This gain or loss should be short-term capital gain or loss unless you hold the Notes for more than one year, in which case the gain or loss should be long-term capital gain or loss, whether or not you are an initial purchaser of the Notes at the issue price. The deductibility of capital losses is subject to limitations. If you sell your Notes between the time your right to a Contingent Coupon payment is fixed and the time it is paid, it is likely that you will be treated as receiving ordinary income equal to the Contingent Coupon payment. Although uncertain, it is possible that proceeds received from the sale or exchange of your Notes prior to an Observation Date but that can be attributed to an expected Contingent Coupon payment could be treated as ordinary income. You should consult your tax advisor regarding this issue. As noted above, there are other reasonable treatments that the IRS or a court may adopt, in which case the timing and character of any income or loss on the Notes could be materially affected. In addition, in 2007 the U.S. Treasury Department and the IRS released a notice requesting comments on the U.S. federal income tax treatment of “prepaid forward contracts” and similar instruments. The notice focuses in particular on whether to require investors in these instruments to accrue income over the term of their investment. It also asks for comments on a number of related topics, including the character of income or loss with respect to these instruments and the relevance of factors such as the nature of the underlying property to which the instruments are linked. While the notice requests comments on appropriate transition rules and effective dates, any Treasury regulations or other guidance promulgated after consideration of these issues could materially affect the tax consequences of an investment in the Notes, possibly with retroactive effect. You should consult your tax advisor regarding the U.S. federal income tax consequences of an investment in the Notes, including possible alternative treatments and the issues presented by this notice. Non-U.S. holders. Insofar as we have responsibility as a withholding agent, we do not currently intend to treat Contingent Coupon payments to non-U.S. holders (as defined in the accompanying prospectus supplement) as subject to U.S. withholding tax. However, non-U.S. holders should in any event expect to be required to provide appropriate Forms W-8 or other documentation in order to establish an exemption from backup withholding, as described under the heading “—Information Reporting and Backup Withholding” in the accompanying prospectus supplement. If any withholding is required, we will not be required to pay any additional amounts with respect to amounts withheld. Treasury regulations under Section 871(m) generally impose a withholding tax on certain “dividend equivalents” under certain “equity linked instruments.” A recent IRS notice excludes from the scope of Section 871(m) instruments issued prior to January 1, 2025 that do not have a “delta of one” with respect to underlying securities that could pay U.S.-source dividends for U.S. federal income tax purposes (each an “Underlying Security”). Based on our determination that the Notes do not have a “delta of one” within the meaning of the regulations, we expect that these regulations will not apply to the Notes with regard to non-U.S. holders. Our determination is not binding on the IRS, and the IRS may disagree with this determination. Section 871(m) is complex and its application may depend on your particular circumstances, including whether you enter into other transactions with respect to an Underlying Security. If necessary, further information regarding the potential application of Section 871(m) will be provided in the pricing supplement for the Notes. You should consult your tax advisor regarding the potential application of Section 871(m) to the Notes. PS—20 SUPPLEMENTAL PLAN OF DISTRIBUTION We will agree to sell to Barclays Capital Inc. (the “Agent”), and the Agent will agree to purchase from us, the principal amount of the Notes, and at the price, specified on the cover of this pricing supplement. The Agent will commit to take and pay for all of the Notes, if any are taken. PS—21\n"

We urge you to consult your investment, legal, tax, accounting and other advisors before you invest in the Notes. You may access these documents on the SEC website at www.sec.gov as follows (or if such address has changed, by reviewing our filings for the relevant date on the SEC website): ● Prospectus dated May 23, 2022: http://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/312070/000119312522157585/d337542df3asr.htm ● Prospectus Supplement dated June 27, 2022: http://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0000312070/000095010322011301/dp169388_424b2-prosupp.htm ● Underlying Supplement dated June 27, 2022: http://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0000312070/000095010322011304/dp169384_424b2-underl.htm Our SEC file number is 1—10257.

PS—3 CONSENT TO U.K. BAIL-IN POWER Notwithstanding and to the exclusion of any other term of the Notes or any other agreements, arrangements or understandings between us and any holder or beneficial owner of the Notes (or the Trustee on behalf of the holders of the Notes), by acquiring the Notes, each holder and beneficial owner of the Notes acknowledges, accepts, agrees to be bound by, and consents to the exercise of, any U.K. Bail-in Power by the relevant U.K. resolution authority. Under the U.K. Banking Act 2009, as amended, the relevant U.K. resolution authority may exercise a U.K. Bail-in Power in circumstances in which the relevant U.K. resolution authority is satisfied that the resolution conditions are met. These conditions include that a U.K. bank or investment firm is failing or is likely to fail to satisfy the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 (the “FSMA”) threshold conditions for authorization to carry on certain regulated activities (within the meaning of section 55B FSMA) or, in the case of a U.K. banking group company that is a European Economic Area (“EEA”) or third country institution or investment firm, that the relevant EEA or third country relevant authority is satisfied that the resolution conditions are met in respect of that entity. The U.K. Bail-in Power includes any write-down, conversion, transfer, modification and/or suspension power, which allows for (i) the reduction or cancellation of all, or a portion, of the principal amount of, interest on, or any other amounts payable on, the Notes; (ii) the conversion of all, or a portion, of the principal amount of, interest on, or any other amounts payable on, the Notes into shares or other securities or other obligations of Barclays Bank PLC or another person (and the issue to, or conferral on, the holder or beneficial owner of the Notes such shares, securities or obligations); (iii) the cancellation of the Notes and/or (iv) the amendment or alteration of the maturity of the Notes, or amendment of the amount of interest or any other amounts due on the Notes, or the dates on which interest or any other amounts become payable, including by suspending payment for a temporary period; which U.K. Bail-in Power may be exercised by means of a variation of the terms of the Notes solely to give effect to the exercise by the relevant U.K. resolution authority of such U.K. Bail-in Power. Each holder and beneficial owner of the Notes further acknowledges and agrees that the rights of the holders or beneficial owners of the Notes are subject to, and will be varied, if necessary, solely to give effect to, the exercise of any U.K. Bail-in Power by the relevant U.K. resolution authority. For the avoidance of doubt, this consent and acknowledgment is not a waiver of any rights holders or beneficial owners of the Notes may have at law if and to the extent that any U.K. Bail-in Power is exercised by the relevant U.K. resolution authority in breach of laws applicable in England. For more information, please see “Selected Risk Considerations—Risks Relating to the Issuer—You May Lose Some or All of Your Investment If Any U.K. Bail-in Power Is Exercised by the Relevant U.K. Resolution Authority” in this pricing supplement as well as “U.K. Bail-in Power,” “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to the Securities Generally—Regulatory action in the event a bank or investment firm in the Group is failing or likely to fail, including the exercise by the relevant U.K. resolution authority of a variety of statutory resolution powers, could materially adversely affect the value of any securities” and “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to the Securities Generally—Under the terms of the securities, you have agreed to be bound by the exercise of any U.K. Bail-in Power by the relevant U.K. resolution authority” in the accompanying prospectus supplement. PS—4 ADDITIONAL INFORMATION REGARDING OUR ESTIMATED VALUE OF THE NOTES The range of the estimated values of the Notes referenced above may not correlate on a linear basis with the range of any other term of the Notes as may be set forth in this pricing supplement. We determined the size of such range based on prevailing market conditions, as well as the anticipated duration of the marketing period for the Notes. The final terms for the Notes will be determined on the date the Notes are initially priced for sale to the public, which we refer to as the Initial Valuation Date, based on prevailing market conditions on or prior to the Initial Valuation Date, and will be communicated to investors either orally or in a final pricing supplement. Our internal pricing models take into account a number of variables and are based on a number of subjective assumptions, which may or may not materialize, typically including volatility, interest rates, and our internal funding rates. Our internal funding rates (which are our internally published borrowing rates based on variables such as market benchmarks, our appetite for borrowing, and our existing obligations coming to maturity) may vary from the levels at which our benchmark debt securities trade in the secondary market. Our estimated value on the Initial Valuation Date is based on our internal funding rates. Our estimated value of the Notes may be lower if such valuation were based on the levels at which our benchmark debt securities trade in the secondary market. Our estimated value of the Notes on the Initial Valuation Date is expected to be less than the initial issue price of the Notes. The difference between the initial issue price of the Notes and our estimated value of the Notes is a result of several factors, including any sales commissions to be paid to Barclays Capital Inc. or another affiliate of ours, any selling concessions, discounts, commissions or fees (including any structuring or other distribution related fees) to be allowed or paid to non-affiliated intermediaries, the estimated profit that we or any of our affiliates expect to earn in connection with structuring the Notes, the estimated cost which we may incur in hedging our obligations under the Notes, and estimated development and other costs which we may incur in connection with the Notes. Our estimated value on the Initial Valuation Date is not a prediction of the price at which the Notes may trade in the secondary market, nor will it be the price at which Barclays Capital Inc. may buy or sell the Notes in the secondary market. Subject to normal market and funding conditions, Barclays Capital Inc. or another affiliate of ours intends to offer to purchase the Notes in the secondary market but it is not obligated to do so. Assuming that all relevant factors remain constant after the Initial Valuation Date, the price at which Barclays Capital Inc. may initially buy or sell the Notes in the secondary market, if any, and the value that we may initially use for customer account statements, if we provide any customer account statements at all, may exceed our estimated value on the Initial Valuation Date for a temporary period expected to be approximately six months after the Issue Date because, in our discretion, we may elect to effectively reimburse to investors a portion of the estimated cost of hedging our obligations under the Notes and other costs in connection with the Notes which we will no longer expect to incur over the term of the Notes. We made such discretionary election and determined this temporary reimbursement period on the basis of a number of factors, which may include the tenor of the Notes and/or any agreement we may have with the distributors of the Notes. The amount of our estimated costs which we effectively reimburse to investors in this way may not be allocated ratably throughout the reimbursement period, and we may discontinue such reimbursement at any time or revise the duration of the reimbursement period after the initial Issue Date of the Notes based on changes in market conditions and other factors that cannot be predicted. We urge you to read the “Selected Risk Considerations” beginning on page PS-14\\xa0of this pricing supplement. You may revoke your offer to purchase the Notes at any time prior to the Initial Valuation Date. We reserve the right to change the terms of, or reject any offer to purchase, the Notes prior to the Initial Valuation Date. In the event of any changes to the terms of the Notes, we will notify you and you will be asked to accept such changes in connection with your purchase. You may also choose to reject such changes in which case we may reject your offer to purchase. PS—5 SELECTED PURCHASE CONSIDERATIONS The Notes are not suitable for all investors. The Notes may be a suitable investment for you if all of the following statements are true: ● You do not seek an investment that produces fixed periodic interest or coupon payments or other non-contingent sources of current income, and you can tolerate receiving few or no Contingent Coupons over the term of the Notes in the event the Closing Value of any Reference Asset falls below its Coupon Barrier Value on one or more of the specified Observation Dates. ● You understand and accept that you will not participate in any appreciation of any Reference Asset, which may be significant, and that your return potential on the Notes is limited to the Contingent Coupons, if any, paid on the Notes. ● You can tolerate a loss of a significant portion or all of the principal amount of your Notes, and you are willing and able to make an investment that may have the full downside market risk of an investment in the Least Performing Reference Asset. ● You do not anticipate that the Closing Value of any Reference Asset will fall below its Coupon Barrier Value on any Observation Date or below its Barrier Value on the Final Valuation Date. ● You understand and accept that you will not be entitled to receive dividends or distributions that may be paid to holders of any Reference Asset or any securities to which any Reference Asset provides exposure, nor will you have any voting rights with respect to any Reference Asset or any securities to which any Reference Asset provides exposure. ● You are willing and able to accept the individual market risk of each Reference Asset and understand that any decline in the value of one Reference Asset will not be offset or mitigated by a lesser decline or any potential increase in the value of any other Reference Asset. ● You understand and accept the risks that (a) you will not receive a Contingent Coupon if the Closing Value of any Reference Asset is less than its Coupon Barrier Value on an Observation Date and (b) you will lose some or all of your principal at maturity if the Final Value of any Reference Asset is less than its Barrier Value. ● You understand and accept the risk that, if the Notes are not redeemed prior to scheduled maturity, the payment at maturity, if any, will be based solely on the Reference Asset Return of the Least Performing Reference Asset. ● You understand and are willing and able to accept the risks associated with an investment linked to the performance of the Reference Assets. ● You are willing and able to accept the risk that the Notes may be redeemed prior to scheduled maturity and that you may not be able to reinvest your money in an alternative investment with comparable risk and yield. ● You can tolerate fluctuations in the price of the Notes prior to scheduled maturity that may be similar to or exceed the downside fluctuations in the values of the Reference Assets. ● You do not seek an investment for which there will be an active secondary market, and you are willing and able to hold the Notes to maturity if the Notes are not redeemed. ● You are willing and able to assume our credit risk for all payments on the Notes. ● You are willing and able to consent to the exercise of any U.K. Bail-in Power by any relevant U.K. resolution authority. The Notes may not\\xa0be a suitable investment for you if any of the following statements are true: ● You seek an investment that produces fixed periodic interest or coupon payments or other non-contingent sources of current income, and/or you cannot tolerate receiving few or no Contingent Coupons over the term of the Notes in the event the Closing Value of any Reference Asset falls below its Coupon Barrier Value on one or more of the specified Observation Dates. ● You seek an investment that participates in the full appreciation of any or all of the Reference Assets rather than an investment with a return that is limited to the Contingent Coupons, if any, paid on the Notes. ● You seek an investment that provides for the full repayment of principal at maturity, and/or you are unwilling or unable to accept the risk that you may lose some or all of the principal amount of the Notes in the event that the Final Value of the Least Performing Reference Asset falls below its Barrier Value. ● You anticipate that the Closing Value of at least one Reference Asset will decline during the term of the Notes such that the Closing Value of at least one Reference Asset will fall below its Coupon Barrier Value on one or more Observation Dates and/or the Final Value of at least one Reference Asset will fall below its Barrier Value. ● You are unwilling or unable to accept the individual market risk of each Reference Asset and/or do not understand that any decline in the value of one Reference Asset will not be offset or mitigated by a lesser decline or any potential increase in the value of any other Reference Asset. ● You do not understand and/or are unwilling or unable to accept the risks associated with an investment linked to the performance of the Reference Assets. ● You are unwilling or unable to accept the risk that the negative performance of only one Reference Asset may cause you to not receive Contingent Coupons and/or suffer a loss of principal at maturity, regardless of the performance of any other Reference Asset. ● You are unwilling or unable to accept the risk that the Notes may be redeemed prior to scheduled maturity. ● You seek an investment that entitles you to dividends or distributions on, or voting rights related to any Reference Asset or any securities to which any Reference Asset provides exposure. PS—6 ● You cannot tolerate fluctuations in the price of the Notes prior to scheduled maturity that may be similar to or exceed the downside fluctuations in the values of the Reference Assets. ● You seek an investment for which there will be an active secondary market, and/or you are unwilling or unable to hold the Notes to maturity if the Notes are not redeemed. ● You prefer the lower risk, and therefore accept the potentially lower returns, of fixed income investments with comparable maturities and credit ratings. ● You are unwilling or unable to assume our credit risk for all payments on the Notes. ● You are unwilling or unable to consent to the exercise of any U.K. Bail-in Power by any relevant U.K. resolution authority. You must rely on your own evaluation of the merits of an investment in the Notes.\\xa0You should reach a decision whether to invest in the Notes after carefully considering, with your advisors, the suitability of the Notes in light of your investment objectives and the specific information set out in this pricing supplement and the documents referenced under “Additional Documents Related to the Offering of the Notes” in this pricing supplement. Neither the Issuer nor Barclays Capital Inc. makes any recommendation as to the suitability of the Notes for investment. PS—7 ADDITIONAL TERMS OF THE NOTES The Observation Dates (including the Final Valuation Date), the Contingent Coupon Payment Dates, any Call Settlement Date and the Maturity Date are subject to postponement in certain circumstances, as described under “Reference Assets—Indices—Market Disruption Events for Securities with an Index of Equity Securities as a Reference Asset,” “Reference Assets—Exchange-Traded Funds—Market Disruption Events for Securities with an Exchange-Traded Fund that Holds Equity Securities as a Reference Asset,” “Reference Assets—Least or Best Performing Reference Asset—Scheduled Trading Days and Market Disruption Events for Securities Linked to the Reference Asset with the Lowest or Highest Return in a Group of Two or More Equity Securities, Exchange-Traded Funds and/or Indices of Equity Securities” and “Terms of the Notes—Payment Dates” in the accompanying prospectus supplement. In addition, the Reference Assets and the Notes are subject to adjustment by the Calculation Agent under certain circumstances, as described under “Reference Assets—Indices—Adjustments Relating to Securities with an Index as a Reference Asset” and “Reference Assets—Exchange-Traded Funds—Adjustments Relating to Securities with an Exchange-Traded Fund as a Reference Asset” in the accompanying prospectus supplement. PS—8 HYPOTHETICAL EXAMPLES OF AMOUNTS PAYABLE ON A SINGLE CONTINGENT COUPON PAYMENT DATE The following examples demonstrate the circumstances under which you may receive a Contingent Coupon on a hypothetical Contingent Coupon Payment Date. The numbers appearing in these tables are purely hypothetical and are provided for illustrative purposes only. These examples do not take into account any tax consequences from investing in the Notes and make the following key assumptions: ■ Hypothetical\\xa0Initial Value of each Reference Asset: 100.00* ■ Hypothetical\\xa0Coupon Barrier Value for each Reference Asset: 70.00 (70.00% of the hypothetical Initial Value set forth above)* ■ Hypothetical\\xa0Call Value for each Reference Asset: 100.00 (100.00% of the hypothetical Initial Value set forth above)* * The hypothetical Initial Value of 100.00, the hypothetical Coupon Barrier Value of 70.00 and the hypothetical\\xa0Call Value of 100.00 for each Reference Asset have been chosen for illustrative purposes only and do not represent a likely Initial Value, Coupon Barrier Value or Call Value for any Reference Asset. The actual Initial Value for each Reference Asset will be equal to its Closing Value on the Initial Valuation Date and the actual Coupon Barrier Value and Call Value for each Reference Asset will be equal to 70.00% and 100.00%, respectively, of its Initial Value. Example 1: The Closing Value of each Reference Asset is greater than its Coupon Barrier Value on the relevant Observation Date. Reference Asset Closing Value on Relevant Observation Date NDX Index 99.00 IWN Fund $75.00 RTY Index 80.00 Because the Closing Value of each Reference Asset is greater than its respective Coupon Barrier Value, you will receive a Contingent Coupon of $9.792 (0.9792% of the principal amount per Note) on the related Contingent Coupon Payment Date. Example 2: The Closing Value of one Reference Asset is greater than its Coupon Barrier Value on the relevant Observation Date and the Closing Value of at least one Reference Asset is less than its Coupon Barrier Value on the relevant Observation Date. Reference Asset Closing Value on Relevant Observation Date NDX Index 80.00 IWN Fund $69.00 RTY Index 50.00 Because the Closing Value of at least one Reference Asset is less than its Coupon Barrier Value, you will not receive a Contingent Coupon on the related Contingent Coupon Payment Date. Example 3: The Closing Value of each Reference Asset is less than its Coupon Barrier Value on the relevant Observation Date. Reference Asset Closing Value on Relevant Observation Date NDX Index 68.00 IWN Fund $50.00 RTY Index 45.00 Because the Closing Value of at least one Reference Asset is less than its Coupon Barrier Value, you will not receive a Contingent Coupon on the related Contingent Coupon Payment Date. Examples 2 and 3 demonstrate that you may not receive a Contingent Coupon on a Contingent Coupon Payment Date. If the Closing Value of any Reference Asset is below its Coupon Barrier Value on each Observation Date, you will not receive any Contingent Coupons during the term of the Notes. In each of the examples above, because the Closing Value of at least one Reference Asset is below its Call Value on the relevant Call Valuation Date, the Notes will not be redeemed on such date. The Notes will be redeemed only if the Closing Value of each Reference Asset on any Call Valuation Date is greater than or equal to its respective Call Value. PS—9 HYPOTHETICAL EXAMPLES OF AMOUNTS PAYABLE UPON AUTOMATIC CALL The following examples demonstrate the hypothetical total return upon an Automatic Call under various circumstances. The “total return” as used in these examples is the number, expressed as a percentage, that results from comparing the aggregate payments per $1,000 principal amount Note to $1,000. The hypothetical total returns set forth below are for illustrative purposes only and may not be the actual total returns applicable to a purchaser of the Notes. The numbers appearing in the following tables and examples have been rounded for ease of analysis. The hypothetical examples below do not take into account any tax consequences from investing in the Notes and make the following key assumption: ■ For each Observation Date that is not also a Call Valuation Date, the Closing Value of at least one Reference Asset is less than its Coupon Barrier Value. Accordingly, you will NOT\\xa0receive Contingent Coupons on those Observation Dates, unless indicated otherwise below. Example 1: The Notes are redeemed on the first Call Valuation Date. Call Valuation Date Is the Closing Value of any Reference Asset Less Than\\xa0its Coupon Barrier Value? Is the Closing Value of any Reference Asset Less Than\\xa0its Call Value? Payment on Contingent Coupon Payment Date\\xa0(per $1,000 principal amount Note) 1 No No $1,009.792 Because the Closing Value of each Reference Asset on the first Call Valuation Date is greater than or equal to its Call Value, the Notes are redeemed and you will receive the Redemption Price on the related Call Settlement Date. The Notes will cease to be outstanding after the Call Settlement Date, and you will not receive any further payments on the Notes. The total return on investment of the Notes is 0.9792%. Example 2: The Notes are redeemed on the\\xa0third Call Valuation Date. Call Valuation Date Is the Closing Value of any Reference Asset Less Than\\xa0its Coupon Barrier Value? Is the Closing Value of any Reference Asset Less Than\\xa0its Call Value? Payment on Contingent Coupon Payment Date\\xa0(per $1,000 principal amount Note) 1 No Yes $9.792 2 Yes Yes $0.00 3 No No $1,009.792 Because the Closing Value of each Reference Asset on the third Call Valuation Date is greater than or equal to its Call Value, the Notes are redeemed and you will receive the Redemption Price on the related Call Settlement Date. The Notes will cease to be outstanding after the Call Settlement Date, and you will not receive any further payments on the Notes. The total return on investment of the Notes is 1.9584%. Example 3: The Notes are redeemed on the final Call Valuation Date. Call Valuation Date Is the Closing Value of any Reference Asset Less Than\\xa0its Coupon Barrier Value? Is the Closing Value of any Reference Asset Less Than\\xa0its Call Value? Payment on Contingent Coupon Payment Date\\xa0(per $1,000 principal amount Note) 1 Yes Yes $0.00 2 - 20 With respect to each Call Valuation Date, Yes With respect to each Call Valuation Date, Yes $0.00 21 No No $1,009.792 Because the Closing Value of each Reference Asset on the final Call Valuation Date is greater than or equal to its Call Value, the Notes are redeemed and you will receive the Redemption Price on the related Call Settlement Date. Example 3 demonstrates that the Closing Value of at least one Reference Asset is less than its Coupon Barrier Value on each Observation Date prior to the final Call Valuation Date. Accordingly, no Contingent Coupons are payable on the Notes until the final Call Valuation Date. The Notes will cease to be outstanding after the Call Settlement Date, and you will not receive any further payments on the Notes. The total return on investment of the Notes is 0.9792%. Each of the examples above demonstrate that the return on the Notes upon an Automatic Call will be limited to the Contingent Coupons, if any, that may be payable on the Notes up to and including the applicable Call Settlement Date. PS—10 Each of the examples above demonstrate that a Contingent Coupon will be payable on a Contingent Coupon Payment Date only if the Closing Value of each Reference Asset is greater than or equal to its respective Coupon Barrier Value on an Observation Date. If the Closing Value of any Reference Asset on an Observation Date is less than its Coupon Barrier Value, you will not receive a Contingent Coupon on the related Contingent Coupon Payment Date. If the Closing Value of any Reference Asset is less than its Coupon Barrier Value on each Observation Date, you will not receive any Contingent Coupons during the term of the Notes. PS—11 HYPOTHETICAL EXAMPLES OF AMOUNTS PAYABLE AT MATURITY The following table illustrates the hypothetical payment at maturity under various circumstances. The examples set forth below are purely hypothetical and are provided for illustrative purposes only. The numbers appearing in the following table and examples have been rounded for ease of analysis. The hypothetical examples below do not take into account any tax consequences from investing in the Notes and make the following key assumptions: ■ Hypothetical\\xa0Initial Value of each Reference Asset: 100.00* ■ Hypothetical\\xa0Coupon Barrier Value for each Reference Asset: 70.00 (70.00% of the hypothetical Initial Value set forth above)* ■ Hypothetical\\xa0Barrier Value for each Reference Asset: 70.00 (70.00% of the hypothetical Initial Value set forth above)* ■ You hold the Notes to maturity, and the Notes are NOT\\xa0redeemed prior to scheduled maturity. * The hypothetical Initial Value of 100.00, the hypothetical Coupon Barrier Value of 70.00 and the hypothetical\\xa0Barrier Value of 70.00 for each Reference Asset have been chosen for illustrative purposes only and do not represent a likely Initial Value, Coupon Barrier Value or Barrier Value for any Reference Asset. The actual Initial Value for each Reference Asset will be equal to its Closing Value on the Initial Valuation Date, and the actual Coupon Barrier Value and Barrier Value for each Reference Asset will each be equal to 70.00% of its Initial Value. For information regarding recent values of the Reference Assets, please see “Information Regarding the Reference Assets” in this pricing supplement.

The following examples illustrate how the payments at maturity set forth in the table above are calculated: Example 1: The Final Value of Reference Asset A is 135.00, the Final Value of Reference Asset B is $130.00 and the Final Value of Reference Asset C is 140.00. Because Reference Asset B has the lowest Reference Asset Return, Reference Asset B is the Least Performing Reference Asset. Because the Final Value of the Least Performing Reference Asset is greater than or equal to its Barrier Value, you will receive a payment at maturity of $1,000 per $1,000 principal amount Note that you hold (plus\\xa0the Contingent Coupon that will otherwise be payable on the Maturity Date). PS—12 Example 2: The Final Value of Reference Asset A is 140.00, the Final Value of Reference Asset B is $90.00 and the Final Value of Reference Asset C is 105.00. Because Reference Asset B has the lowest Reference Asset Return, Reference Asset B is the Least Performing Reference Asset. Because the Final Value of the Least Performing Reference Asset is greater than or equal to its Barrier Value, you will receive a payment at maturity of $1,000 per $1,000 principal amount Note that you hold (plus the Contingent Coupon that will otherwise be payable on the Maturity Date). Example 3: The Final Value of Reference Asset A is 60.00, the Final Value of Reference Asset B is $120.00 and the Final Value of Reference Asset C is 100.00. Because Reference Asset A has the lowest Reference Asset Return, Reference Asset A is the Least Performing Reference Asset. Because the Final Value of the Least Performing Reference Asset is less than its Barrier Value, you will receive a payment at maturity of $600.00 per $1,000 principal amount Note that you hold, calculated as follows: $1,000 + [$1,000 × Reference Asset Return of the Least Performing Reference Asset] $1,000 + [$1,000 × -40.00%] = $600.00 In addition, because the Final Value of at least one Reference Asset is less than its Coupon Barrier Value, you will not receive a Contingent Coupon on the Maturity Date. Example 3 demonstrates that if the Notes are not redeemed prior to scheduled maturity, and if the Final Value of the Least Performing Reference Asset is less than its Barrier Value, your investment in the Notes will be fully exposed to the decline of the Least Performing Reference Asset from its Initial Value. You will not benefit in any way from the Reference Asset Return of any other Reference Asset being higher than the Reference Asset Return of the Least Performing Reference Asset. If the Notes are not redeemed prior to scheduled maturity, you may lose up to\\xa0100.00% of the principal amount of your Notes. Any payment on the Notes, including the repayment of principal, is subject to the credit risk of Barclays Bank PLC. PS—13 SELECTED RISK CONSIDERATIONS An investment in the Notes involves significant risks. Investing in the Notes is not equivalent to investing directly in the Reference Assets or their components, if any. Some of the risks that apply to an investment in the Notes are summarized below, but we urge you to read the more detailed explanation of risks relating to the Notes generally in the “Risk Factors” section of the prospectus supplement. You should not purchase the Notes unless you understand and can bear the risks of investing in the Notes. Risks Relating to the Notes Generally ● Your Investment in the Notes May Result in a Significant Loss — The Notes differ from ordinary debt securities in that the Issuer will not necessarily repay the full principal amount of the Notes at maturity. If the Notes are not redeemed prior to scheduled maturity, and if the Final Value of the Least Performing Reference Asset is less than its Barrier Value, your Notes will be fully exposed to the decline of the Least Performing Reference Asset from its Initial Value. You may lose up to\\xa0100.00% of the principal amount of your Notes. ● Potential Return is Limited to the Contingent Coupons, If Any, and You Will Not Participate in Any Appreciation of Any Reference Asset\\xa0— The potential positive return on the Notes is limited to the Contingent Coupons, if any, that may be payable during the term of the Notes. You will not participate in any appreciation in the value of any Reference Asset, which may be significant, even though you will be exposed to the depreciation in the value of the Least Performing Reference Asset if the Notes are not redeemed and the Final Value of the Least Performing Reference Asset is less than its Barrier Value. ● You May Not Receive Any Contingent Coupon Payments on the Notes — The Issuer will not necessarily make periodic coupon payments on the Notes. You will receive a Contingent Coupon on a Contingent Coupon Payment Date only if\\xa0the Closing Value of each Reference Asset on the related Observation Date is greater than or equal to its respective Coupon Barrier Value. If the Closing Value of any Reference Asset on an Observation Date is less than its Coupon Barrier Value, you will not receive a Contingent Coupon on the related Contingent Coupon Payment Date. If the Closing Value of at least one Reference Asset is less than its respective Coupon Barrier Value on each Observation Date, you will not receive any Contingent Coupons during the term of the Notes. ● Because the Notes Are Linked to the Least Performing Reference Asset, You Are Exposed to Greater Risks of No Contingent Coupons and Sustaining a Significant Loss of Principal at Maturity Than If the Notes Were Linked to a Single Reference Asset\\xa0— The risk that you will not receive any Contingent Coupons and lose a significant portion or all of your principal amount in the Notes at maturity is greater if you invest in the Notes as opposed to substantially similar securities that are linked to the performance of a single Reference Asset. With multiple Reference Assets, it is more likely that the Closing Value of at least one Reference Asset will be less than its Coupon Barrier Value on the specified Observation Dates or less than its Barrier Value on the Final Valuation Date, and therefore, it is more likely that you will not receive any Contingent Coupons and that you will suffer a significant loss of principal at maturity. Further, the performance of the Reference Assets may not be correlated or may be negatively correlated. The lower the correlation between multiple Reference Assets, the greater the potential for one of those Reference Assets to close below its Coupon Barrier Value or Barrier Value on an Observation Date or the Final Valuation Date, respectively. It is impossible to predict what the correlation among the Reference Assets will be over the term of the Notes. The Reference Assets represent different equity markets. These different equity markets may not perform similarly over the term of the Notes. Although the correlation of the Reference Assets’ performance may change over the term of the Notes, the Contingent Coupon rate is determined, in part, based on the correlation of the Reference Assets’ performance calculated using our internal models at the time when the terms of the Notes are finalized. A higher Contingent Coupon is generally associated with lower correlation of the Reference Assets, which reflects a greater potential for missed Contingent Coupons and for a loss of principal at maturity. ● You Are Exposed to the Market Risk of Each Reference Asset\\xa0— Your return on the Notes is not linked to a basket consisting of the Reference Assets. Rather, it will be contingent upon the independent performance of each Reference Asset. Unlike an instrument with a return linked to a basket of underlying assets in which risk is mitigated and diversified among all the components of the basket, you will be exposed to the risks related to each Reference Asset. Poor performance by any Reference Asset over the term of the Notes may negatively affect your return and will not be offset or mitigated by any increases or lesser declines in the value of any other Reference Asset. To receive a Contingent Coupon, the Closing Value of each Reference Asset must be greater than or equal to its Coupon Barrier Value on the applicable Observation Date. In addition, if the Notes have not been redeemed prior to scheduled maturity, and if the Final Value of any Reference Asset is less than its Barrier Value, you will be exposed to the full decline in the Least Performing Reference Asset from its Initial Value. Accordingly, your investment is subject to the market risk of each Reference Asset. ● The Notes Are Subject to Volatility Risk\\xa0— Volatility is a measure of the degree of variation in the price of an asset (or level of an index) over a period of time. The amount of any coupon payments that may be payable under the Notes is based on a number of factors, including the expected volatility of the Reference Assets. The amount of such coupon payments will be paid at a per annum rate that is higher than the fixed rate that we would pay on a conventional debt security of the same tenor and is higher than it otherwise would have been had the expected volatility of the Reference Assets been lower. As volatility of a Reference Asset increases, there will typically be a greater likelihood that (a) the Closing Value of that Reference Asset on one or more Observation Dates will be less than its Coupon Barrier Value and (b) the Final Value of that Reference Asset will be less than its Barrier Value. PS—14 Accordingly, you should understand that a higher coupon payment amount reflects, among other things, an indication of a greater likelihood that you will (a) not receive coupon payments with respect to one or more Observation Dates and/or (b) incur a loss of principal at maturity than would have been the case had the amount of such coupon payments been lower. In addition, actual volatility over the term of the Notes may be significantly higher than the expected volatility at the time the terms of the Notes were determined. If actual volatility is higher than expected, you will face an even greater risk that you will not receive coupon payments and/or that you will lose some or all of your principal at maturity for the reasons described above. ● Early Redemption and Reinvestment Risk\\xa0— While the original term of the Notes is as indicated on the cover of this pricing supplement, the Notes may be redeemed prior to maturity, as described above, and the holding period over which you may receive any coupon payments that may be payable under the Notes could be as short as approximately three months. The Redemption Price that you would receive on a Call Settlement Date, together with any coupon payments that you may have received prior to the Call Settlement Date, may be less than the aggregate amount of payments that you would have received had the Notes not been redeemed. There is no guarantee that you would be able to reinvest the proceeds from an investment in the Notes in a comparable investment with a similar level of risk in the event the Notes are redeemed prior to the Maturity Date. No additional payments will be due after the relevant Call Settlement Date. The fact that the Notes may be redeemed prior to maturity may also adversely impact your ability to sell your Notes and the price at which they may be sold. ● Any Payment on the Notes Will Be Determined Based on the Closing Values of the Reference Assets on the Dates Specified — Any payment on the Notes will be determined based on the Closing Values of the Reference Assets on the dates specified. You will not benefit from any more favorable values of the Reference Assets determined at any other time. ● Contingent Repayment of Any Principal Amount Applies Only at Maturity or upon Any Redemption\\xa0— You should be willing to hold your Notes to maturity or any redemption. Although the Notes provide for the contingent repayment of the principal amount of your Notes at maturity, provided that the Final Value of the Least Performing Reference Asset is greater than or equal to its Barrier Value, or upon any redemption, if you sell your Notes prior to such time in the secondary market, if any, you may have to sell your Notes at a price that is less than the principal amount even if at that time the value of each Reference Asset has increased from its Initial Value. See “Many Economic and Market Factors Will Impact the Value of the Notes” below. ● Owning the Notes is Not the Same as Owning Any Reference Asset or Any Securities to which Any Reference Asset Provides Exposure\\xa0— The return on the Notes may not reflect the return you would realize if you actually owned any Reference Asset or any securities to which any Reference Asset provides exposure. As a holder of the Notes, you will not have voting rights or rights to receive dividends or other distributions or any other rights that holders of any Reference Asset or any securities to which any Reference Asset provides exposure may have. ● Tax Treatment\\xa0— Significant aspects of the tax treatment of the Notes are uncertain. You should consult your tax advisor about your tax situation. See “Tax Considerations” below. Risks Relating to the Issuer ● Credit of Issuer\\xa0— The Notes are unsecured and unsubordinated debt obligations of the Issuer, Barclays Bank PLC, and are not, either directly or indirectly, an obligation of any third party. Any payment to be made on the Notes, including any repayment of principal, is subject to the ability of Barclays Bank PLC to satisfy its obligations as they come due and is not guaranteed by any third party. As a result, the actual and perceived creditworthiness of Barclays Bank PLC may affect the market value of the Notes, and in the event Barclays Bank PLC were to default on its obligations, you may not receive any amounts owed to you under the terms of the Notes. ● You May Lose Some or All of Your Investment If Any U.K. Bail-in Power Is Exercised by the Relevant U.K. Resolution Authority\\xa0— Notwithstanding and to the exclusion of any other term of the Notes or any other agreements, arrangements or understandings between Barclays Bank PLC and any holder or beneficial owner of the Notes (or the Trustee on behalf of the holders of the Notes), by acquiring the Notes, each holder and beneficial owner of the Notes acknowledges, accepts, agrees to be bound by, and consents to the exercise of, any U.K. Bail-in Power by the relevant U.K. resolution authority as set forth under “Consent to U.K. Bail-in Power” in this pricing supplement. Accordingly, any U.K. Bail-in Power may be exercised in such a manner as to result in you and other holders and beneficial owners of the Notes losing all or a part of the value of your investment in the Notes or receiving a different security from the Notes, which may be worth significantly less than the Notes and which may have significantly fewer protections than those typically afforded to debt securities. Moreover, the relevant U.K. resolution authority may exercise the U.K. Bail-in Power without providing any advance notice to, or requiring the consent of, the holders and beneficial owners of the Notes. The exercise of any U.K. Bail-in Power by the relevant U.K. resolution authority with respect to the Notes will not be a default or an Event of Default (as each term is defined in the senior debt securities indenture) and the trustee will not be liable for any action that the trustee takes, or abstains from taking, in either case, in accordance with the exercise of the U.K. Bail-in Power by the relevant U.K. resolution authority with respect to the Notes. See “Consent to U.K. Bail-in Power” in this pricing supplement as well as “U.K. Bail-in Power,” “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to the Securities Generally—Regulatory action in the event a bank or investment firm in the Group is failing or likely to fail, including the exercise by the relevant U.K. resolution authority of a variety of statutory resolution powers, could materially adversely affect the value of any securities” and “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to the Securities Generally—Under the terms of the securities, you have agreed to be bound by the exercise of any U.K. Bail-in Power by the relevant U.K. resolution authority” in the accompanying prospectus supplement. PS—15 Risks Relating to the Reference Assets ● Historical Performance of the Reference Assets Should Not Be Taken as Any Indication of the Future Performance of the Reference Assets Over the Term of the Notes\\xa0— The value of each Reference Asset has fluctuated in the past and may, in the future, experience significant fluctuations. The historical performance of a Reference Asset is not an indication of the future performance of that Reference Asset over the term of the Notes. The historical correlation among the Reference Assets is not an indication of the future correlation among them over the term of the Notes. Therefore, the performance of the Reference Assets individually or in comparison to each other over the term of the Notes may bear no relation or resemblance to the historical performance of any Reference Asset. ● Each Index Reflects the Price Return of the Securities Composing that Index, Not the Total Return\\xa0— The return on the Notes is based on the performance of the Indices, which reflects changes in the market prices of the securities composing that Index. The Indices are not \"total return\" indices that, in addition to reflecting those price returns, would also reflect dividends paid on the securities composing that Index. Accordingly, the return on the Notes will not include such a total return feature. ● Adjustments to Any Index Could Adversely Affect the Value of the Notes\\xa0— The sponsor of any Index may add, delete, substitute or adjust the securities composing that Index or make other methodological changes to that Index that could affect its value. The Calculation Agent will calculate the value to be used as the Closing Value of that Index in the event of certain material changes in or modifications to that Index. In addition, the sponsor of any Index may also discontinue or suspend calculation or publication of that Index at any time. Under these circumstances, the Calculation Agent may select a successor index that the Calculation Agent determines to be comparable to that Index or, if no successor index is available, the Calculation Agent will determine the value to be used as the Closing Value of that Index. Any of these actions could adversely affect the value of any Index and, consequently, the value of the Notes. See “Reference Assets—Indices—Adjustments Relating to Securities with an Index as a Reference Asset” in the accompanying prospectus supplement. ● The Notes Are Subject to Risks Associated with Non-U.S. Securities Markets\\xa0— Certain component securities of the NDX Index are issued by non-U.S. companies in non-U.S. securities markets. Investments in securities linked to the value of such non-U.S. equity securities, such as the Notes, involve risks associated with the securities markets in the home countries of the issuers of those non-U.S. equity securities, including risks of volatility in those markets, governmental intervention in those markets and cross shareholdings in companies in certain countries. Also, there is generally less publicly available information about companies in some of these jurisdictions than there is about U.S. companies that are subject to the reporting requirements of the SEC, and generally non-U.S. companies are subject to accounting, auditing and financial reporting standards and requirements and securities trading rules different from those applicable to U.S. reporting companies. The prices of securities in non-U.S. markets may be affected by political, economic, financial and social factors in those countries, or global regions, including changes in government, economic and fiscal policies and currency exchange laws. ● The Notes Are Subject to Small-Capitalization Companies Risk with Respect to the RTY Index and the IWN Fund\\xa0— The RTY Index tracks companies that are considered small-capitalization companies and the IWN Fund holds component securities that are issued by companies that are considered small-capitalization companies. These companies often have greater stock price volatility, lower trading volume and less liquidity than large-capitalization companies, and therefore Notes linked to the RTY Index or the IWN Fund may be more volatile than an investment linked to an index with component stocks issued by large-capitalization companies. Stock prices of small-capitalization companies are also more vulnerable than those of large-capitalization companies to adverse business and economic developments. In addition, small-capitalization companies are typically less stable financially than large-capitalization companies and may depend on a small number of key personnel, making them more vulnerable to loss of personnel. Small-capitalization companies are often subject to less analyst coverage and may be in early, and less predictable, periods of their corporate existences. Such companies tend to have smaller revenues, less diverse product lines, smaller shares of their product or service markets, fewer financial resources and less competitive strengths than large-capitalization companies and are more susceptible to adverse developments related to their products. ● Certain Features of Exchange-Traded Funds Will Impact the Value of the Notes\\xa0— The performance of the IWN Fund will not fully replicate the performance of its Underlying Index (as defined below), and the IWN Fund may hold securities not included in its Underlying Index. The value of the IWN Fund is subject to: ■ Management Risk. This is the risk that the investment strategy for the IWN Fund, the implementation of which is subject to a number of constraints, may not produce the intended results. However, the IWN Fund is not actively managed and the investment advisor of the IWN Fund will generally not attempt to take defensive positions in declining markets. ■ Derivatives Risk. The IWN Fund may invest in derivatives, including forward contracts, futures contracts, options on futures contracts, options and swaps. A derivative is a financial contract, the value of which depends on, or is derived from, the value of an underlying asset such as a security or an index. Compared to conventional securities, derivatives can be more sensitive to changes in interest rates or to sudden fluctuations in market prices, and thus the IWN Fund’s losses, and, as a consequence, the losses on your Notes, may be greater than if the IWN Fund invested only in conventional securities. ■ Transaction costs and fees. Unlike its Underlying Index, the IWN Fund will reflect transaction costs and fees that will reduce its performance relative to its Underlying Index. Generally, the longer the time remaining to maturity, the more the market price of the Notes will be affected by the factors described above. In addition, the IWN Fund may diverge significantly from the performance of its Underlying Index due to differences in trading hours between the IWN Fund and the securities composing its Underlying Index or other circumstances. PS—16 During periods of market volatility, the component securities held by the IWN Fund may be unavailable in the secondary market, market participants may be unable to calculate accurately the intraday net asset value per share of the IWN Fund and the liquidity of the IWN Fund may be adversely affected. This kind of market volatility may also disrupt the ability of market participants to create and redeem shares in the IWN Fund. Further, market volatility may adversely affect, sometimes materially, the prices at which market participants are willing to buy and sell shares of the IWN Fund. As a result, under these circumstances, the market value of the IWN Fund may vary substantially from the net asset value per share of the IWN Fund. Because the Notes are linked to the performance of the IWN Fund and not its Underlying Index, the return on your Notes may be less than that of an alternative investment linked directly to its Underlying Index. ● Adjustments to the IWN Fund or its Underlying Index Could Adversely Affect the Value of the Notes or Result in the Notes Being Accelerated\\xa0— The investment adviser of the IWN Fund may add, delete or substitute the component securities held by the IWN Fund or make changes to its investment strategy, and the sponsor of the Underlying Index that the IWN Fund is designed to track may add, delete, substitute or adjust the securities composing its Underlying Index or make other methodological changes to its Underlying Index that could affect its performance. In addition, if the shares of the IWN Fund are delisted or if the IWN Fund is liquidated or otherwise terminated, the Calculation Agent may select a successor fund that the Calculation Agent determines to be comparable to the IWN Fund or, if no successor fund is available, the Maturity Date of the Notes will be accelerated for a payment determined by the Calculation Agent. Any of these actions could adversely affect the value of the IWN Fund and, consequently, the value of the Notes. Any amount payable upon acceleration could be significantly less than the amount(s) that would be due on the securities if they were not accelerated. See “Reference Assets—Exchange-Traded Funds—Adjustments Relating to Securities with an Exchange-Traded Fund as a Reference Asset—Discontinuance of an Exchange-Traded Fund” in the accompanying prospectus supplement. ● Anti-Dilution Protection Is Limited, and the Calculation Agent Has Discretion to Make Anti-Dilution Adjustments\\xa0— The Calculation Agent may in its sole discretion make adjustments affecting the amounts payable on the Notes upon the occurrence of certain events that the Calculation Agent determines have a diluting or concentrative effect on the theoretical value of the shares of the IWN Fund. However, the Calculation Agent might not make such adjustments in response to all events that could affect the shares of the IWN Fund. The occurrence of any such event and any adjustment made by the Calculation Agent (or a determination by the Calculation Agent not to make any adjustment) may adversely affect any amounts payable on the Notes. See “Reference Assets—Exchange-Traded Funds—Adjustments Relating to Securities with an Exchange-Traded Fund as a Reference Asset—Anti-dilution Adjustments” in the accompanying prospectus supplement. ● The Investment Strategy Represented by the IWN Fund May Not be Successful — The IWN Fund is intended to represent a “value” investment strategy.\\xa0The IWN Fund seeks to track the investment results, before fees and expenses, of an index composed of small-capitalization U.S. equities that exhibit value characteristics, which is currently the Underlying Index. The Underlying Index measures the capitalization weighted price performance of the stocks included in the Russell 2000® Index that are determined by the sponsor of the Underlying Index to be value oriented, with lower price-to-book ratios and lower forecasted and historical growth. A “value” investment strategy is premised on the goal of investing in stocks that are determined to be relatively cheap or “undervalued” under the assumption that the value of those stocks will increase over time as the market comes to recognize and reflect the “fair” market value of those stocks. However, stocks that are considered value stocks may fail to appreciate for extended periods of time, and may never realize their full potential value. Moreover, the value characteristics referenced by the Underlying Index may not be accurate predictors of undervalued stocks. In addition, the Underlying Index’s selection methodology includes a significant bias against stocks with strong growth characteristics, and stocks with strong growth characteristics may outperform stocks with weak growth characteristics. There is no assurance that the Underlying Index will outperform any other index or strategy that tracks U.S. stocks selected using other criteria and may underperform the Russell 2000®\\xa0Index as a whole. It is possible that the stock selection methodology of the Underlying Index will adversely affect its return and, consequently, the level of the Underlying Index and the value and return of the Notes. Risks Relating to Conflicts of Interest ● We and Our Affiliates May Engage in Various Activities or Make Determinations That Could Materially Affect the Notes in Various Ways and Create Conflicts of Interest\\xa0— We and our affiliates play a variety of roles in connection with the issuance of the Notes, as described below. In performing these roles, our and our affiliates’ economic interests are potentially adverse to your interests as an investor in the Notes. In connection with our normal business activities and in connection with hedging our obligations under the Notes, we and our affiliates make markets in and trade various financial instruments or products for our accounts and for the account of our clients and otherwise provide investment banking and other financial services with respect to these financial instruments and products. These financial instruments and products may include securities, derivative instruments or assets that may relate to the Reference Assets or their components, if any. In any such market making, trading and hedging activity, and other financial services, we or our affiliates may take positions or take actions that are inconsistent with, or adverse to, the investment objectives of the holders of the Notes. We and our affiliates have no obligation to take the needs of any buyer, seller or holder of the Notes into account in conducting these activities. Such market making, trading and hedging activity, investment banking and other financial services may negatively impact the value of the Notes. In addition, the role played by Barclays Capital Inc., as the agent for the Notes, could present significant conflicts of interest with the role of Barclays Bank PLC, as issuer of the Notes. For example, Barclays Capital Inc. or its representatives may derive compensation or financial benefit from the distribution of the Notes and such compensation or financial benefit may serve as PS—17 incentive to sell the Notes instead of other investments. Furthermore, we and our affiliates establish the offering price of the Notes for initial sale to the public, and the offering price is not based upon any independent verification or valuation. In addition to the activities described above, we will also act as the Calculation Agent for the Notes. As Calculation Agent, we will determine any values of the Reference Assets and make any other determinations necessary to calculate any payments on the Notes. In making these determinations, the Calculation Agent may be required to make discretionary judgements relating to the Reference Assets, including determining whether a market disruption event has occurred or whether certain adjustments to the Reference Assets or other terms of the Notes are necessary, as further described in the accompanying prospectus supplement. In making these discretionary judgments, our economic interests are potentially adverse to your interests as an investor in the Notes, and any of these determinations may adversely affect any payments on the Notes. Risks Relating to the Estimated Value of the Notes and the Secondary Market ● The Estimated Value of Your Notes is Expected to be Lower Than the Initial Issue Price of Your Notes\\xa0— The estimated value of your Notes on the Initial Valuation Date is expected to be lower, and may be significantly lower, than the initial issue price of your Notes. The difference between the initial issue price of your Notes and the estimated value of the Notes is a result of certain factors, such as any sales commissions to be paid to Barclays Capital Inc. or another affiliate of ours, any selling concessions, discounts, commissions or fees (including any structuring or other distribution related fees) to be allowed or paid to non-affiliated intermediaries, the estimated profit that we or any of our affiliates expect to earn in connection with structuring the Notes, the estimated cost which we may incur in hedging our obligations under the Notes, and estimated development and other costs which we may incur in connection with the Notes. ● The Estimated Value of Your Notes Might be Lower if Such Estimated Value Were Based on the Levels at Which Our Debt Securities Trade in the Secondary Market\\xa0— The estimated value of your Notes on the Initial Valuation Date is based on a number of variables, including our internal funding rates. Our internal funding rates may vary from the levels at which our benchmark debt securities trade in the secondary market. As a result of this difference, the estimated value referenced above might be lower if such estimated value were based on the levels at which our benchmark debt securities trade in the secondary market. ● The Estimated Value of the Notes is Based on Our Internal Pricing Models, Which May Prove to be Inaccurate and May be Different from the Pricing Models of Other Financial Institutions\\xa0— The estimated value of your Notes on the Initial Valuation Date is based on our internal pricing models, which take into account a number of variables and are based on a number of subjective assumptions, which may or may not materialize. These variables and assumptions are not evaluated or verified on an independent basis. Further, our pricing models may be different from other financial institutions’ pricing models and the methodologies used by us to estimate the value of the Notes may not be consistent with those of other financial institutions which may be purchasers or sellers of Notes in the secondary market. As a result, the secondary market price of your Notes may be materially different from the estimated value of the Notes determined by reference to our internal pricing models. ● The Estimated Value of Your Notes Is Not a Prediction of the Prices at Which You May Sell Your Notes in the Secondary Market, if any, and Such Secondary Market Prices, If Any, Will Likely be Lower Than the Initial Issue Price of Your Notes and May be Lower Than the Estimated Value of Your Notes\\xa0— The estimated value of the Notes will not be a prediction of the prices at which Barclays Capital Inc., other affiliates of ours or third parties may be willing to purchase the Notes from you in secondary market transactions (if they are willing to purchase, which they are not obligated to do). The price at which you may be able to sell your Notes in the secondary market at any time will be influenced by many factors that cannot be predicted, such as market conditions, and any bid and ask spread for similar sized trades, and may be substantially less than our estimated value of the Notes. Further, as secondary market prices of your Notes take into account the levels at which our debt securities trade in the secondary market, and do not take into account our various costs related to the Notes such as fees, commissions, discounts, and the costs of hedging our obligations under the Notes, secondary market prices of your Notes will likely be lower than the initial issue price of your Notes. As a result, the price at which Barclays Capital Inc., other affiliates of ours or third parties may be willing to purchase the Notes from you in secondary market transactions, if any, will likely be lower than the price you paid for your Notes, and any sale prior to the Maturity Date could result in a substantial loss to you. ● The Temporary Price at Which We May Initially Buy The Notes in the Secondary Market And the Value We May Initially Use for Customer Account Statements, If We Provide Any Customer Account Statements At All, May Not Be Indicative of Future Prices of Your Notes\\xa0— Assuming that all relevant factors remain constant after the Initial Valuation Date, the price at which Barclays Capital Inc. may initially buy or sell the Notes in the secondary market (if Barclays Capital Inc. makes a market in the Notes, which it is not obligated to do) and the value that we may initially use for customer account statements, if we provide any customer account statements at all, may exceed our estimated value of the Notes on the Initial Valuation Date, as well as the secondary market value of the Notes, for a temporary period after the initial Issue Date of the Notes. The price at which Barclays Capital Inc. may initially buy or sell the Notes in the secondary market and the value that we may initially use for customer account statements may not be indicative of future prices of your Notes. ● Lack of Liquidity — The Notes will not be listed on any securities exchange. Barclays Capital Inc. and other affiliates of Barclays Bank PLC intend to make a secondary market for the Notes but are not required to do so, and may discontinue any such secondary market making at any time, without notice. Barclays Capital Inc. may at any time hold unsold inventory, which may inhibit the development of a secondary market for the Notes. Even if there is a secondary market, it may not provide enough liquidity to allow you to trade or sell the Notes easily. Because other dealers are not likely to make a secondary market PS—18 for the Notes, the price at which you may be able to trade your Notes is likely to depend on the price, if any, at which Barclays Capital Inc. and other affiliates of Barclays Bank PLC are willing to buy the Notes. The Notes are not designed to be short-term trading instruments. Accordingly, you should be willing and able to hold your Notes to maturity. ● Many Economic and Market Factors Will Impact the Value of the Notes\\xa0— The value of the Notes will be affected by a number of economic and market factors that interact in complex and unpredictable ways and that may either offset or magnify each other, including: o the market price of, dividend rate on and expected volatility of the Reference Assets or the components of the Reference Assets, if any; o correlation (or lack of correlation) of the Reference Assets; o the time to maturity of the Notes; o interest and yield rates in the market generally; o a variety of economic, financial, political, regulatory or judicial events; o supply and demand for the Notes; and o our creditworthiness, including actual or anticipated downgrades in our credit ratings.

Historical Performance of the Russell 2000®\\xa0Index PAST PERFORMANCE IS NOT INDICATIVE OF FUTURE RESULTS PS—22 TAX CONSIDERATIONS You should review carefully the sections in the accompanying prospectus supplement entitled “Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences—Tax Consequences to U.S. Holders—Notes Treated as Prepaid Forward or Derivative Contracts with Associated Contingent Coupons” and, if you are a non-U.S. holder, “—Tax Consequences to Non-U.S. Holders.” The following discussion supersedes the discussion in the accompanying prospectus supplement to the extent it is inconsistent therewith. In determining our reporting responsibilities, if any, we intend to treat (i) the Notes for U.S. federal income tax purposes as prepaid forward contracts with associated contingent coupons and (ii) any Contingent Coupon payments as ordinary income, as described in the section entitled “Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences—Tax Consequences to U.S. Holders—Notes Treated as Prepaid Forward or Derivative Contracts with Associated Contingent Coupons” in the accompanying prospectus supplement. Our special tax counsel, Davis Polk & Wardwell LLP, has advised that it believes this treatment to be reasonable, but that there are other reasonable treatments that the Internal Revenue Service (the “IRS”) or a court may adopt. Sale, exchange or redemption of a Note.\\xa0Assuming the treatment described above is respected, upon a sale or exchange of the Notes (including redemption upon an automatic call or at maturity), you should recognize capital gain or loss equal to the difference between the amount realized on the sale or exchange and your tax basis in the Notes, which should equal the amount you paid to acquire the Notes (assuming Contingent Coupon payments are properly treated as ordinary income, consistent with the position referred to above). This gain or loss should be short-term capital gain or loss unless you hold the Notes for more than one year, in which case the gain or loss should be long-term capital gain or loss, whether or not you are an initial purchaser of the Notes at the issue price. The deductibility of capital losses is subject to limitations. If you sell your Notes between the time your right to a Contingent Coupon payment is fixed and the time it is paid, it is likely that you will be treated as receiving ordinary income equal to the Contingent Coupon payment. Although uncertain, it is possible that proceeds received from the sale or exchange of your Notes prior to an Observation Date but that can be attributed to an expected Contingent Coupon payment could be treated as ordinary income. You should consult your tax advisor regarding this issue. As noted above, there are other reasonable treatments that the IRS or a court may adopt, in which case the timing and character of any income or loss on the Notes could be materially affected. In addition, in 2007 the U.S. Treasury Department and the IRS released a notice requesting comments on the U.S. federal income tax treatment of “prepaid forward contracts” and similar instruments. The notice focuses in particular on whether to require investors in these instruments to accrue income over the term of their investment. It also asks for comments on a number of related topics, including the character of income or loss with respect to these instruments and the relevance of factors such as the nature of the underlying property to which the instruments are linked. While the notice requests comments on appropriate transition rules and effective dates, any Treasury regulations or other guidance promulgated after consideration of these issues could materially affect the tax consequences of an investment in the Notes, possibly with retroactive effect. You should consult your tax advisor regarding the U.S. federal income tax consequences of an investment in the Notes, including possible alternative treatments and the issues presented by this notice. Non-U.S. holders.\\xa0Insofar as we have responsibility as a withholding agent, we do not currently intend to treat Contingent Coupon payments to non-U.S. holders (as defined in the accompanying prospectus supplement) as subject to U.S. withholding tax. However, non-U.S. holders should in any event expect to be required to provide appropriate Forms W-8 or other documentation in order to establish an exemption from backup withholding, as described under the heading “—Information Reporting and Backup Withholding” in the accompanying prospectus supplement. If any withholding is required, we will not be required to pay any additional amounts with respect to amounts withheld. Treasury regulations under Section 871(m) generally impose a withholding tax on certain “dividend equivalents” under certain “equity linked instruments.” A recent IRS notice excludes from the scope of Section 871(m) instruments issued prior to January 1, 2025 that do not have a “delta of one” with respect to underlying securities that could pay U.S.-source dividends for U.S. federal income tax purposes (each an “Underlying Security”). Based on our determination that the Notes do not have a “delta of one” within the meaning of the regulations, we expect that these regulations will not apply to the Notes with regard to non-U.S. holders. Our determination is not binding on the IRS, and the IRS may disagree with this determination. Section 871(m) is complex and its application may depend on your particular circumstances, including whether you enter into other transactions with respect to an Underlying Security. If necessary, further information regarding the potential application of Section 871(m) will be provided in the pricing supplement for the Notes. You should consult your tax advisor regarding the potential application of Section 871(m) to the Notes. PS—23 SUPPLEMENTAL PLAN OF DISTRIBUTION We will agree to sell to Barclays Capital Inc. (the “Agent”), and the Agent will agree to purchase from us, the principal amount of the Notes, and at the price, specified on the cover of this pricing supplement.

This pricing supplement, together with the documents listed below, contains the terms of the Notes and supersedes all prior or contemporaneous oral statements as well as any other written materials including preliminary or indicative pricing terms, correspondence, trade ideas, structures for implementation, sample structures, brochures or other educational materials of ours. You should carefully consider, among other things, the matters set forth under “Risk Factors” in the prospectus supplement and “Selected Risk Considerations” in this pricing supplement, as the Notes involve risks not associated with conventional debt securities. We urge you to consult your investment, legal, tax, accounting and other advisors before you invest in the Notes. You may access these documents on the SEC website at www.sec.gov as follows (or if such address has changed, by reviewing our filings for the relevant date on the SEC website): ● Prospectus dated May 23, 2022: http://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/312070/000119312522157585/d337542df3asr.htm ● Prospectus Supplement dated June 27, 2022: http://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0000312070/000095010322011301/dp169388_424b2-prosupp.htm ● Underlying Supplement dated June 27, 2022: http://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0000312070/000095010322011304/dp169384_424b2-underl.htm Our SEC file number is 1—10257.

PS—3 CONSENT TO U.K. BAIL-IN POWER Notwithstanding and to the exclusion of any other term of the Notes or any other agreements, arrangements or understandings between us and any holder or beneficial owner of the Notes (or the Trustee on behalf of the holders of the Notes), by acquiring the Notes, each holder and beneficial owner of the Notes acknowledges, accepts, agrees to be bound by, and consents to the exercise of, any U.K. Bail-in Power by the relevant U.K. resolution authority. Under the U.K. Banking Act 2009, as amended, the relevant U.K. resolution authority may exercise a U.K. Bail-in Power in circumstances in which the relevant U.K. resolution authority is satisfied that the resolution conditions are met. These conditions include that a U.K. bank or investment firm is failing or is likely to fail to satisfy the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 (the “FSMA”) threshold conditions for authorization to carry on certain regulated activities (within the meaning of section 55B FSMA) or, in the case of a U.K. banking group company that is a European Economic Area (“EEA”) or third country institution or investment firm, that the relevant EEA or third country relevant authority is satisfied that the resolution conditions are met in respect of that entity. The U.K. Bail-in Power includes any write-down, conversion, transfer, modification and/or suspension power, which allows for (i) the reduction or cancellation of all, or a portion, of the principal amount of, interest on, or any other amounts payable on, the Notes; (ii) the conversion of all, or a portion, of the principal amount of, interest on, or any other amounts payable on, the Notes into shares or other securities or other obligations of Barclays Bank PLC or another person (and the issue to, or conferral on, the holder or beneficial owner of the Notes such shares, securities or obligations); (iii) the cancellation of the Notes and/or (iv) the amendment or alteration of the maturity of the Notes, or amendment of the amount of interest or any other amounts due on the Notes, or the dates on which interest or any other amounts become payable, including by suspending payment for a temporary period; which U.K. Bail-in Power may be exercised by means of a variation of the terms of the Notes solely to give effect to the exercise by the relevant U.K. resolution authority of such U.K. Bail-in Power. Each holder and beneficial owner of the Notes further acknowledges and agrees that the rights of the holders or beneficial owners of the Notes are subject to, and will be varied, if necessary, solely to give effect to, the exercise of any U.K. Bail-in Power by the relevant U.K. resolution authority. For the avoidance of doubt, this consent and acknowledgment is not a waiver of any rights holders or beneficial owners of the Notes may have at law if and to the extent that any U.K. Bail-in Power is exercised by the relevant U.K. resolution authority in breach of laws applicable in England. For more information, please see “Selected Risk Considerations—Risks Relating to the Issuer—You May Lose Some or All of Your Investment If Any U.K. Bail-in Power Is Exercised by the Relevant U.K. Resolution Authority” in this pricing supplement as well as “U.K. Bail-in Power,” “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to the Securities Generally—Regulatory action in the event a bank or investment firm in the Group is failing or likely to fail, including the exercise by the relevant U.K. resolution authority of a variety of statutory resolution powers, could materially adversely affect the value of any securities” and “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to the Securities Generally—Under the terms of the securities, you have agreed to be bound by the exercise of any U.K. Bail-in Power by the relevant U.K. resolution authority” in the accompanying prospectus supplement. PS—4 ADDITIONAL INFORMATION REGARDING OUR ESTIMATED VALUE OF THE NOTES The range of the estimated values of the Notes referenced above may not correlate on a linear basis with the range of any other term of the Notes as may be set forth in this pricing supplement. We determined the size of such range based on prevailing market conditions, as well as the anticipated duration of the marketing period for the Notes. The final terms for the Notes will be determined on the date the Notes are initially priced for sale to the public, which we refer to as the Initial Valuation Date, based on prevailing market conditions on or prior to the Initial Valuation Date, and will be communicated to investors either orally or in a final pricing supplement. Our internal pricing models take into account a number of variables and are based on a number of subjective assumptions, which may or may not materialize, typically including volatility, interest rates, and our internal funding rates. Our internal funding rates (which are our internally published borrowing rates based on variables such as market benchmarks, our appetite for borrowing, and our existing obligations coming to maturity) may vary from the levels at which our benchmark debt securities trade in the secondary market. Our estimated value on the Initial Valuation Date is based on our internal funding rates. Our estimated value of the Notes may be lower if such valuation were based on the levels at which our benchmark debt securities trade in the secondary market. Our estimated value of the Notes on the Initial Valuation Date is expected to be less than the initial issue price of the Notes. The difference between the initial issue price of the Notes and our estimated value of the Notes is a result of several factors, including any sales commissions to be paid to Barclays Capital Inc. or another affiliate of ours, any selling concessions, discounts, commissions or fees (including any structuring or other distribution related fees) to be allowed or paid to non-affiliated intermediaries, the estimated profit that we or any of our affiliates expect to earn in connection with structuring the Notes, the estimated cost which we may incur in hedging our obligations under the Notes, and estimated development and other costs which we may incur in connection with the Notes. Our estimated value on the Initial Valuation Date is not a prediction of the price at which the Notes may trade in the secondary market, nor will it be the price at which Barclays Capital Inc. may buy or sell the Notes in the secondary market. Subject to normal market and funding conditions, Barclays Capital Inc. or another affiliate of ours intends to offer to purchase the Notes in the secondary market but it is not obligated to do so. Assuming that all relevant factors remain constant after the Initial Valuation Date, the price at which Barclays Capital Inc. may initially buy or sell the Notes in the secondary market, if any, and the value that we may initially use for customer account statements, if we provide any customer account statements at all, may exceed our estimated value on the Initial Valuation Date for a temporary period expected to be approximately three months after the Issue Date because, in our discretion, we may elect to effectively reimburse to investors a portion of the estimated cost of hedging our obligations under the Notes and other costs in connection with the Notes which we will no longer expect to incur over the term of the Notes. We made such discretionary election and determined this temporary reimbursement period on the basis of a number of factors, which may include the tenor of the Notes and/or any agreement we may have with the distributors of the Notes. The amount of our estimated costs which we effectively reimburse to investors in this way may not be allocated ratably throughout the reimbursement period, and we may discontinue such reimbursement at any time or revise the duration of the reimbursement period after the initial Issue Date of the Notes based on changes in market conditions and other factors that cannot be predicted. We urge you to read the “Selected Risk Considerations” beginning on page PS-12\\xa0of this pricing supplement. You may revoke your offer to purchase the Notes at any time prior to the Initial Valuation Date. We reserve the right to change the terms of, or reject any offer to purchase, the Notes prior to the Initial Valuation Date. In the event of any changes to the terms of the Notes, we will notify you and you will be asked to accept such changes in connection with your purchase. You may also choose to reject such changes in which case we may reject your offer to purchase. PS—5 SELECTED PURCHASE CONSIDERATIONS The Notes are not suitable for all investors. The Notes may be a suitable investment for you if all of the following statements are true: ● You do not seek an investment that produces fixed periodic interest or coupon payments or other non-contingent sources of current income, and you can tolerate receiving few or no Contingent Coupons over the term of the Notes in the event the Closing Value of any Reference Asset falls below its Coupon Barrier Value on one or more of the specified Observation Dates. ● You understand and accept that you will not participate in any appreciation of any Reference Asset, which may be significant, and that your return potential on the Notes is limited to the Contingent Coupons, if any, paid on the Notes. ● You can tolerate a loss of a significant portion or all of the principal amount of your Notes, and you are willing and able to make an investment that may have the full downside market risk of an investment in the Least Performing Reference Asset. ● You do not anticipate that the Closing Value of any Reference Asset will fall below its Coupon Barrier Value on any Observation Date or below its Barrier Value on the Final Valuation Date. ● You understand and accept that you will not be entitled to receive dividends or distributions that may be paid to holders of any Reference Asset or any securities to which any Reference Asset provides exposure, nor will you have any voting rights with respect to any Reference Asset or any securities to which any Reference Asset provides exposure. ● You are willing and able to accept the individual market risk of each Reference Asset and understand that any decline in the value of one Reference Asset will not be offset or mitigated by a lesser decline or any potential increase in the value of any other Reference Asset. ● You understand and accept the risks that (a) you will not receive a Contingent Coupon if the Closing Value of any Reference Asset is less than its Coupon Barrier Value on an Observation Date and (b) you will lose some or all of your principal at maturity if the Final Value of any Reference Asset is less than its Barrier Value. ● You understand and accept the risk that, if the Notes are not redeemed prior to scheduled maturity, the payment at maturity, if any, will be based solely on the Reference Asset Return of the Least Performing Reference Asset. ● You understand and are willing and able to accept the risks associated with an investment linked to the performance of the Reference Assets. ● You are willing and able to accept the risk that the Notes may be redeemed prior to scheduled maturity and that you may not be able to reinvest your money in an alternative investment with comparable risk and yield. ● You can tolerate fluctuations in the price of the Notes prior to scheduled maturity that may be similar to or exceed the downside fluctuations in the values of the Reference Assets. ● You do not seek an investment for which there will be an active secondary market, and you are willing and able to hold the Notes to maturity if the Notes are not redeemed. ● You are willing and able to assume our credit risk for all payments on the Notes. ● You are willing and able to consent to the exercise of any U.K. Bail-in Power by any relevant U.K. resolution authority. The Notes may not\\xa0be a suitable investment for you if any of the following statements are true: ● You seek an investment that produces fixed periodic interest or coupon payments or other non-contingent sources of current income, and/or you cannot tolerate receiving few or no Contingent Coupons over the term of the Notes in the event the Closing Value of any Reference Asset falls below its Coupon Barrier Value on one or more of the specified Observation Dates. ● You seek an investment that participates in the full appreciation of any or all of the Reference Assets rather than an investment with a return that is limited to the Contingent Coupons, if any, paid on the Notes. ● You seek an investment that provides for the full repayment of principal at maturity, and/or you are unwilling or unable to accept the risk that you may lose some or all of the principal amount of the Notes in the event that the Final Value of the Least Performing Reference Asset falls below its Barrier Value. ● You anticipate that the Closing Value of at least one Reference Asset will decline during the term of the Notes such that the Closing Value of at least one Reference Asset will fall below its Coupon Barrier Value on one or more Observation Dates and/or the Final Value of at least one Reference Asset will fall below its Barrier Value. ● You are unwilling or unable to accept the individual market risk of each Reference Asset and/or do not understand that any decline in the value of one Reference Asset will not be offset or mitigated by a lesser decline or any potential increase in the value of any other Reference Asset. ● You do not understand and/or are unwilling or unable to accept the risks associated with an investment linked to the performance of the Reference Assets. ● You are unwilling or unable to accept the risk that the negative performance of only one Reference Asset may cause you to not receive Contingent Coupons and/or suffer a loss of principal at maturity, regardless of the performance of any other Reference Asset. ● You are unwilling or unable to accept the risk that the Notes may be redeemed prior to scheduled maturity. ● You seek an investment that entitles you to dividends or distributions on, or voting rights related to any Reference Asset or any securities to which any Reference Asset provides exposure. PS—6 ● You cannot tolerate fluctuations in the price of the Notes prior to scheduled maturity that may be similar to or exceed the downside fluctuations in the values of the Reference Assets. ● You seek an investment for which there will be an active secondary market, and/or you are unwilling or unable to hold the Notes to maturity if the Notes are not redeemed. ● You prefer the lower risk, and therefore accept the potentially lower returns, of fixed income investments with comparable maturities and credit ratings. ● You are unwilling or unable to assume our credit risk for all payments on the Notes. ● You are unwilling or unable to consent to the exercise of any U.K. Bail-in Power by any relevant U.K. resolution authority. You must rely on your own evaluation of the merits of an investment in the Notes.\\xa0You should reach a decision whether to invest in the Notes after carefully considering, with your advisors, the suitability of the Notes in light of your investment objectives and the specific information set out in this pricing supplement and the documents referenced under “Additional Documents Related to the Offering of the Notes” in this pricing supplement. Neither the Issuer nor Barclays Capital Inc. makes any recommendation as to the suitability of the Notes for investment. PS—7 ADDITIONAL TERMS OF THE NOTES The Observation Dates (including the Final Valuation Date), the Contingent Coupon Payment Dates, any Call Settlement Date and the Maturity Date are subject to postponement in certain circumstances, as described under “Reference Assets—Indices—Market Disruption Events for Securities with an Index of Equity Securities as a Reference Asset,” “Reference Assets—Least or Best Performing Reference Asset—Scheduled Trading Days and Market Disruption Events for Securities Linked to the Reference Asset with the Lowest or Highest Return in a Group of Two or More Equity Securities, Exchange-Traded Funds and/or Indices of Equity Securities” and “Terms of the Notes—Payment Dates” in the accompanying prospectus supplement. In addition, the Reference Assets and the Notes are subject to adjustment by the Calculation Agent under certain circumstances, as described under “Reference Assets—Indices—Adjustments Relating to Securities with an Index as a Reference Asset” in the accompanying prospectus supplement. PS—8 HYPOTHETICAL EXAMPLES OF AMOUNTS PAYABLE ON A SINGLE CONTINGENT COUPON PAYMENT DATE The following examples demonstrate the circumstances under which you may receive a Contingent Coupon on a hypothetical Contingent Coupon Payment Date. The numbers appearing in these tables are purely hypothetical and are provided for illustrative purposes only. These examples do not take into account any tax consequences from investing in the Notes and make the following key assumptions: ■ Hypothetical\\xa0Initial Value of each Reference Asset: 100.00* ■ Hypothetical\\xa0Coupon Barrier Value for each Reference Asset: 70.00 (70.00% of the hypothetical Initial Value set forth above)* * The hypothetical Initial Value of 100.00 and the hypothetical\\xa0Coupon Barrier Value of 70.00 for each Reference Asset have been chosen for illustrative purposes only. The actual Initial Value and Coupon Barrier Value for each Reference Asset are as set forth on the cover of this pricing supplement. Example 1: The Closing Value of each Reference Asset is greater than its Coupon Barrier Value on the relevant Observation Date. Reference Asset Closing Value on Relevant Observation Date SPX Index 100.00 RTY Index 75.00 NDX Index 80.00 Because the Closing Value of each Reference Asset is greater than its respective Coupon Barrier Value, you will receive a Contingent Coupon of $9.875 (0.9875% of the principal amount per Note) on the related Contingent Coupon Payment Date. Example 2: The Closing Value of one Reference Asset is greater than its Coupon Barrier Value on the relevant Observation Date and the Closing Value of at least one Reference Asset is less than its Coupon Barrier Value on the relevant Observation Date. Reference Asset Closing Value on Relevant Observation Date SPX Index 80.00 RTY Index 69.00 NDX Index 50.00 Because the Closing Value of at least one Reference Asset is less than its Coupon Barrier Value, you will not receive a Contingent Coupon on the related Contingent Coupon Payment Date. Example 3: The Closing Value of each Reference Asset is less than its Coupon Barrier Value on the relevant Observation Date. Reference Asset Closing Value on Relevant Observation Date SPX Index 68.00 RTY Index 50.00 NDX Index 45.00 Because the Closing Value of at least one Reference Asset is less than its Coupon Barrier Value, you will not receive a Contingent Coupon on the related Contingent Coupon Payment Date. Examples 2 and 3 demonstrate that you may not receive a Contingent Coupon on a Contingent Coupon Payment Date. If the Closing Value of any Reference Asset is below its Coupon Barrier Value on each Observation Date, you will not receive any Contingent Coupons during the term of the Notes. PS—9 HYPOTHETICAL EXAMPLES OF AMOUNTS PAYABLE AT MATURITY The following table illustrates the hypothetical payment at maturity under various circumstances. The examples set forth below are purely hypothetical and are provided for illustrative purposes only. The numbers appearing in the following table and examples have been rounded for ease of analysis. The hypothetical examples below do not take into account any tax consequences from investing in the Notes and make the following key assumptions: ■ Hypothetical\\xa0Initial Value of each Reference Asset: 100.00* ■ Hypothetical\\xa0Coupon Barrier Value for each Reference Asset: 70.00 (70.00% of the hypothetical Initial Value set forth above)* ■ Hypothetical\\xa0Barrier Value for each Reference Asset: 70.00 (70.00% of the hypothetical Initial Value set forth above)* ■ You hold the Notes to maturity, and the Notes are NOT\\xa0redeemed prior to scheduled maturity. * The hypothetical Initial Value of 100.00, the hypothetical Coupon Barrier Value of 70.00 and the hypothetical\\xa0Barrier Value of 70.00 for each Reference Asset have been chosen for illustrative purposes only. The actual Initial Value, Coupon Barrier Value and Barrier Value for each Reference Asset are as set forth on the cover of this pricing supplement.

The following examples illustrate how the payments at maturity set forth in the table above are calculated: Example 1: The Final Value of Reference Asset A is 135.00, the Final Value of Reference Asset B is 130.00 and the Final Value of Reference Asset C is 140.00. Because Reference Asset B has the lowest Reference Asset Return, Reference Asset B is the Least Performing Reference Asset. Because the Final Value of the Least Performing Reference Asset is greater than or equal to its Barrier Value, you will receive a payment at maturity of $1,000 per $1,000 principal amount Note that you hold (plus\\xa0the Contingent Coupon that will otherwise be payable on the Maturity Date). PS—10 Example 2: The Final Value of Reference Asset A is 140.00, the Final Value of Reference Asset B is 90.00 and the Final Value of Reference Asset C is 105.00. Because Reference Asset B has the lowest Reference Asset Return, Reference Asset B is the Least Performing Reference Asset. Because the Final Value of the Least Performing Reference Asset is greater than or equal to its Barrier Value, you will receive a payment at maturity of $1,000 per $1,000 principal amount Note that you hold (plus the Contingent Coupon that will otherwise be payable on the Maturity Date). Example 3: The Final Value of Reference Asset A is 60.00, the Final Value of Reference Asset B is 120.00 and the Final Value of Reference Asset C is 100.00. Because Reference Asset A has the lowest Reference Asset Return, Reference Asset A is the Least Performing Reference Asset. Because the Final Value of the Least Performing Reference Asset is less than its Barrier Value, you will receive a payment at maturity of $600.00 per $1,000 principal amount Note that you hold, calculated as follows: $1,000 + [$1,000 × Reference Asset Return of the Least Performing Reference Asset] $1,000 + [$1,000 × -40.00%] = $600.00 In addition, because the Final Value of at least one Reference Asset is less than its Coupon Barrier Value, you will not receive a Contingent Coupon on the Maturity Date. Example 3 demonstrates that if the Notes are not redeemed prior to scheduled maturity, and if the Final Value of the Least Performing Reference Asset is less than its Barrier Value, your investment in the Notes will be fully exposed to the decline of the Least Performing Reference Asset from its Initial Value. You will not benefit in any way from the Reference Asset Return of any other Reference Asset being higher than the Reference Asset Return of the Least Performing Reference Asset. If the Notes are not redeemed prior to scheduled maturity, you may lose up to\\xa0100.00% of the principal amount of your Notes. Any payment on the Notes, including the repayment of principal, is subject to the credit risk of Barclays Bank PLC. PS—11 SELECTED RISK CONSIDERATIONS An investment in the Notes involves significant risks. Investing in the Notes is not equivalent to investing directly in the Reference Assets or their components, if any. Some of the risks that apply to an investment in the Notes are summarized below, but we urge you to read the more detailed explanation of risks relating to the Notes generally in the “Risk Factors” section of the prospectus supplement. You should not purchase the Notes unless you understand and can bear the risks of investing in the Notes. Risks Relating to the Notes Generally ● Your Investment in the Notes May Result in a Significant Loss — The Notes differ from ordinary debt securities in that the Issuer will not necessarily repay the full principal amount of the Notes at maturity. If the Notes are not redeemed prior to scheduled maturity, and if the Final Value of the Least Performing Reference Asset is less than its Barrier Value, your Notes will be fully exposed to the decline of the Least Performing Reference Asset from its Initial Value. You may lose up to\\xa0100.00% of the principal amount of your Notes. ● Potential Return is Limited to the Contingent Coupons, If Any, and You Will Not Participate in Any Appreciation of Any Reference Asset\\xa0— The potential positive return on the Notes is limited to the Contingent Coupons, if any, that may be payable during the term of the Notes. You will not participate in any appreciation in the value of any Reference Asset, which may be significant, even though you will be exposed to the depreciation in the value of the Least Performing Reference Asset if the Notes are not redeemed and the Final Value of the Least Performing Reference Asset is less than its Barrier Value. ● You May Not Receive Any Contingent Coupon Payments on the Notes — The Issuer will not necessarily make periodic coupon payments on the Notes. You will receive a Contingent Coupon on a Contingent Coupon Payment Date only if\\xa0the Closing Value of each Reference Asset on the related Observation Date is greater than or equal to its respective Coupon Barrier Value. If the Closing Value of any Reference Asset on an Observation Date is less than its Coupon Barrier Value, you will not receive a Contingent Coupon on the related Contingent Coupon Payment Date. If the Closing Value of at least one Reference Asset is less than its respective Coupon Barrier Value on each Observation Date, you will not receive any Contingent Coupons during the term of the Notes. ● Because the Notes Are Linked to the Least Performing Reference Asset, You Are Exposed to Greater Risks of No Contingent Coupons and Sustaining a Significant Loss of Principal at Maturity Than If the Notes Were Linked to a Single Reference Asset\\xa0— The risk that you will not receive any Contingent Coupons and lose a significant portion or all of your principal amount in the Notes at maturity is greater if you invest in the Notes as opposed to substantially similar securities that are linked to the performance of a single Reference Asset. With multiple Reference Assets, it is more likely that the Closing Value of at least one Reference Asset will be less than its Coupon Barrier Value on the specified Observation Dates or less than its Barrier Value on the Final Valuation Date, and therefore, it is more likely that you will not receive any Contingent Coupons and that you will suffer a significant loss of principal at maturity. Further, the performance of the Reference Assets may not be correlated or may be negatively correlated. The lower the correlation between multiple Reference Assets, the greater the potential for one of those Reference Assets to close below its Coupon Barrier Value or Barrier Value on an Observation Date or the Final Valuation Date, respectively. It is impossible to predict what the correlation among the Reference Assets will be over the term of the Notes. The Reference Assets represent different equity markets. These different equity markets may not perform similarly over the term of the Notes. Although the correlation of the Reference Assets’ performance may change over the term of the Notes, the Contingent Coupon rate is determined, in part, based on the correlation of the Reference Assets’ performance calculated using our internal models at the time when the terms of the Notes are finalized. A higher Contingent Coupon is generally associated with lower correlation of the Reference Assets, which reflects a greater potential for missed Contingent Coupons and for a loss of principal at maturity. ● You Are Exposed to the Market Risk of Each Reference Asset\\xa0— Your return on the Notes is not linked to a basket consisting of the Reference Assets. Rather, it will be contingent upon the independent performance of each Reference Asset. Unlike an instrument with a return linked to a basket of underlying assets in which risk is mitigated and diversified among all the components of the basket, you will be exposed to the risks related to each Reference Asset. Poor performance by any Reference Asset over the term of the Notes may negatively affect your return and will not be offset or mitigated by any increases or lesser declines in the value of any other Reference Asset. To receive a Contingent Coupon, the Closing Value of each Reference Asset must be greater than or equal to its Coupon Barrier Value on the applicable Observation Date. In addition, if the Notes have not been redeemed prior to scheduled maturity, and if the Final Value of any Reference Asset is less than its Barrier Value, you will be exposed to the full decline in the Least Performing Reference Asset from its Initial Value. Accordingly, your investment is subject to the market risk of each Reference Asset. ● The Notes Are Subject to Volatility Risk\\xa0— Volatility is a measure of the degree of variation in the price of an asset (or level of an index) over a period of time. The amount of any coupon payments that may be payable under the Notes is based on a number of factors, including the expected volatility of the Reference Assets. The amount of such coupon payments will be paid at a per annum rate that is higher than the fixed rate that we would pay on a conventional debt security of the same tenor and is higher than it otherwise would have been had the expected volatility of the Reference Assets been lower. As volatility of a Reference Asset increases, there will typically be a greater likelihood that (a) the Closing Value of that Reference Asset on one or more Observation Dates will be less than its Coupon Barrier Value and (b) the Final Value of that Reference Asset will be less than its Barrier Value. PS—12 Accordingly, you should understand that a higher coupon payment amount reflects, among other things, an indication of a greater likelihood that you will (a) not receive coupon payments with respect to one or more Observation Dates and/or (b) incur a loss of principal at maturity than would have been the case had the amount of such coupon payments been lower. In addition, actual volatility over the term of the Notes may be significantly higher than the expected volatility at the time the terms of the Notes were determined. If actual volatility is higher than expected, you will face an even greater risk that you will not receive coupon payments and/or that you will lose some or all of your principal at maturity for the reasons described above. ● Early Redemption and Reinvestment Risk\\xa0— While the original term of the Notes is as indicated on the cover of this pricing supplement, the Notes may be redeemed prior to maturity, as described above, and the holding period over which you may receive any coupon payments that may be payable under the Notes could be as short as approximately three months. The Redemption Price that you would receive on a Call Settlement Date, together with any coupon payments that you may have received prior to the Call Settlement Date, may be less than the aggregate amount of payments that you would have received had the Notes not been redeemed. There is no guarantee that you would be able to reinvest the proceeds from an investment in the Notes in a comparable investment with a similar level of risk in the event the Notes are redeemed prior to the Maturity Date. No additional payments will be due after the relevant Call Settlement Date. The fact that the Notes may be redeemed prior to maturity may also adversely impact your ability to sell your Notes and the price at which they may be sold. It is more likely that we will redeem the Notes at our sole discretion prior to maturity to the extent that the expected interest payable on the Notes is greater than the interest that would be payable on other instruments issued by us of comparable maturity, terms and credit rating trading in the market. We are less likely to redeem the Notes prior to maturity when the expected interest payable on the Notes is less than the interest that would be payable on other comparable instruments issued by us, which includes when the value of any Reference Asset is less than its Coupon Barrier Value. Therefore, the Notes are more likely to remain outstanding when the expected interest payable on the Notes is less than what would be payable on other comparable instruments and when your risk of not receiving a Contingent Coupon is relatively higher. ● Any Payment on the Notes Will Be Determined Based on the Closing Values of the Reference Assets on the Dates Specified — Any payment on the Notes will be determined based on the Closing Values of the Reference Assets on the dates specified. You will not benefit from any more favorable values of the Reference Assets determined at any other time. ● Contingent Repayment of Any Principal Amount Applies Only at Maturity or upon Any Redemption\\xa0— You should be willing to hold your Notes to maturity or any redemption. Although the Notes provide for the contingent repayment of the principal amount of your Notes at maturity, provided that the Final Value of the Least Performing Reference Asset is greater than or equal to its Barrier Value, or upon any redemption, if you sell your Notes prior to such time in the secondary market, if any, you may have to sell your Notes at a price that is less than the principal amount even if at that time the value of each Reference Asset has increased from its Initial Value. See “Many Economic and Market Factors Will Impact the Value of the Notes” below. ● Owning the Notes is Not the Same as Owning Any Reference Asset or Any Securities to which Any Reference Asset Provides Exposure\\xa0— The return on the Notes may not reflect the return you would realize if you actually owned any Reference Asset or any securities to which any Reference Asset provides exposure. As a holder of the Notes, you will not have voting rights or rights to receive dividends or other distributions or any other rights that holders of any Reference Asset or any securities to which any Reference Asset provides exposure may have. ● Tax Treatment\\xa0— Significant aspects of the tax treatment of the Notes are uncertain. You should consult your tax advisor about your tax situation. See “Tax Considerations” below. Risks Relating to the Issuer ● Credit of Issuer\\xa0— The Notes are unsecured and unsubordinated debt obligations of the Issuer, Barclays Bank PLC, and are not, either directly or indirectly, an obligation of any third party. Any payment to be made on the Notes, including any repayment of principal, is subject to the ability of Barclays Bank PLC to satisfy its obligations as they come due and is not guaranteed by any third party. As a result, the actual and perceived creditworthiness of Barclays Bank PLC may affect the market value of the Notes, and in the event Barclays Bank PLC were to default on its obligations, you may not receive any amounts owed to you under the terms of the Notes. ● You May Lose Some or All of Your Investment If Any U.K. Bail-in Power Is Exercised by the Relevant U.K. Resolution Authority — Notwithstanding and to the exclusion of any other term of the Notes or any other agreements, arrangements or understandings between Barclays Bank PLC and any holder or beneficial owner of the Notes (or the Trustee on behalf of the holders of the Notes), by acquiring the Notes, each holder and beneficial owner of the Notes acknowledges, accepts, agrees to be bound by, and consents to the exercise of, any U.K. Bail-in Power by the relevant U.K. resolution authority as set forth under “Consent to U.K. Bail-in Power” in this pricing supplement. Accordingly, any U.K. Bail-in Power may be exercised in such a manner as to result in you and other holders and beneficial owners of the Notes losing all or a part of the value of your investment in the Notes or receiving a different security from the Notes, which may be worth significantly less than the Notes and which may have significantly fewer protections than those typically afforded to debt securities. Moreover, the relevant U.K. resolution authority may exercise the U.K. Bail-in Power without providing any advance notice to, or requiring the consent of, the holders and beneficial owners of the Notes. The exercise of any U.K. Bail-in Power by the relevant U.K. resolution authority with respect to the Notes will not be a default or an Event of Default (as each term is defined in the senior debt securities indenture) and the trustee will not be liable for any action that the trustee takes, or abstains from taking, in either PS—13 case, in accordance with the exercise of the U.K. Bail-in Power by the relevant U.K. resolution authority with respect to the Notes. See “Consent to U.K. Bail-in Power” in this pricing supplement as well as “U.K. Bail-in Power,” “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to the Securities Generally—Regulatory action in the event a bank or investment firm in the Group is failing or likely to fail, including the exercise by the relevant U.K. resolution authority of a variety of statutory resolution powers, could materially adversely affect the value of any securities” and “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to the Securities Generally—Under the terms of the securities, you have agreed to be bound by the exercise of any U.K. Bail-in Power by the relevant U.K. resolution authority” in the accompanying prospectus supplement. Risks Relating to the Reference Assets ● Historical Performance of the Reference Assets Should Not Be Taken as Any Indication of the Future Performance of the Reference Assets Over the Term of the Notes\\xa0— The value of each Reference Asset has fluctuated in the past and may, in the future, experience significant fluctuations. The historical performance of a Reference Asset is not an indication of the future performance of that Reference Asset over the term of the Notes. The historical correlation among the Reference Assets is not an indication of the future correlation among them over the term of the Notes. Therefore, the performance of the Reference Assets individually or in comparison to each other over the term of the Notes may bear no relation or resemblance to the historical performance of any Reference Asset. ● Each Reference Asset Reflects the Price Return of the Securities Composing that Reference Asset, Not the Total Return\\xa0— The return on the Notes is based on the performance of the Reference Assets, which reflects changes in the market prices of the securities composing the Reference Assets. The Reference Assets are not \"total return\" indices that, in addition to reflecting those price returns, would also reflect dividends paid on the securities composing that Reference Asset. Accordingly, the return on the Notes will not include such a total return feature. ● Adjustments to Any Reference Asset Could Adversely Affect the Value of the Notes\\xa0— The sponsor of any Reference Asset may add, delete, substitute or adjust the securities composing that Reference Asset or make other methodological changes to that Reference Asset that could affect its value. The Calculation Agent will calculate the value to be used as the Closing Value of that Reference Asset in the event of certain material changes in or modifications to that Reference Asset. In addition, the sponsor of any Reference Asset may also discontinue or suspend calculation or publication of that Reference Asset at any time. Under these circumstances, the Calculation Agent may select a successor index that the Calculation Agent determines to be comparable to that Reference Asset or, if no successor index is available, the Calculation Agent will determine the value to be used as the Closing Value of that Reference Asset. Any of these actions could adversely affect the value of any Reference Asset and, consequently, the value of the Notes. See “Reference Assets—Indices—Adjustments Relating to Securities with an Index as a Reference Asset” in the accompanying prospectus supplement. ● The Notes Are Subject to Risks Associated with Non-U.S. Securities Markets\\xa0— Certain component securities of the NDX Index are issued by non-U.S. companies in non-U.S. securities markets. Investments in securities linked to the value of such non-U.S. equity securities, such as the Notes, involve risks associated with the securities markets in the home countries of the issuers of those non-U.S. equity securities, including risks of volatility in those markets, governmental intervention in those markets and cross shareholdings in companies in certain countries. Also, there is generally less publicly available information about companies in some of these jurisdictions than there is about U.S. companies that are subject to the reporting requirements of the SEC, and generally non-U.S. companies are subject to accounting, auditing and financial reporting standards and requirements and securities trading rules different from those applicable to U.S. reporting companies. The prices of securities in non-U.S. markets may be affected by political, economic, financial and social factors in those countries, or global regions, including changes in government, economic and fiscal policies and currency exchange laws. ● The Notes Are Subject to Risks Associated with Small Capitalization Stocks\\xa0— The RTY Index tracks companies that are considered small-capitalization companies. These companies often have greater stock price volatility, lower trading volume and less liquidity than large-capitalization companies, and therefore securities linked to the RTY Index may be more volatile than an investment linked to an index with component stocks issued by large-capitalization companies. Stock prices of small-capitalization companies are also more vulnerable than those of large-capitalization companies to adverse business and economic developments. In addition, small-capitalization companies are typically less stable financially than large-capitalization companies and may depend on a small number of key personnel, making them more vulnerable to loss of personnel. Small-capitalization companies are often subject to less analyst coverage and may be in early, and less predictable, periods of their corporate existences. Such companies tend to have smaller revenues, less diverse product lines, smaller shares of their product or service markets, fewer financial resources and less competitive strengths than large-capitalization companies and are more susceptible to adverse developments related to their products. Risks Relating to Conflicts of Interest ● We and Our Affiliates May Engage in Various Activities or Make Determinations That Could Materially Affect the Notes in Various Ways and Create Conflicts of Interest\\xa0— We and our affiliates play a variety of roles in connection with the issuance of the Notes, as described below. In performing these roles, our and our affiliates’ economic interests are potentially adverse to your interests as an investor in the Notes. In connection with our normal business activities and in connection with hedging our obligations under the Notes, we and our affiliates make markets in and trade various financial instruments or products for our accounts and for the account of our clients and otherwise provide investment banking and other financial services with respect to these financial instruments and products. PS—14 These financial instruments and products may include securities, derivative instruments or assets that may relate to the Reference Assets or their components, if any. In any such market making, trading and hedging activity, and other financial services, we or our affiliates may take positions or take actions that are inconsistent with, or adverse to, the investment objectives of the holders of the Notes. We and our affiliates have no obligation to take the needs of any buyer, seller or holder of the Notes into account in conducting these activities. Such market making, trading and hedging activity, investment banking and other financial services may negatively impact the value of the Notes. In addition, the role played by Barclays Capital Inc., as the agent for the Notes, could present significant conflicts of interest with the role of Barclays Bank PLC, as issuer of the Notes. For example, Barclays Capital Inc. or its representatives may derive compensation or financial benefit from the distribution of the Notes and such compensation or financial benefit may serve as incentive to sell the Notes instead of other investments. Furthermore, we and our affiliates establish the offering price of the Notes for initial sale to the public, and the offering price is not based upon any independent verification or valuation. In addition to the activities described above, we will also act as the Calculation Agent for the Notes. As Calculation Agent, we will determine any values of the Reference Assets and make any other determinations necessary to calculate any payments on the Notes. In making these determinations, the Calculation Agent may be required to make discretionary judgements relating to the Reference Assets, including determining whether a market disruption event has occurred or whether certain adjustments to the Reference Assets or other terms of the Notes are necessary, as further described in the accompanying prospectus supplement. In making these discretionary judgments, our economic interests are potentially adverse to your interests as an investor in the Notes, and any of these determinations may adversely affect any payments on the Notes. Risks Relating to the Estimated Value of the Notes and the Secondary Market ● The Estimated Value of Your Notes is Expected to be Lower Than the Initial Issue Price of Your Notes\\xa0— The estimated value of your Notes on the Initial Valuation Date is expected to be lower, and may be significantly lower, than the initial issue price of your Notes. The difference between the initial issue price of your Notes and the estimated value of the Notes is a result of certain factors, such as any sales commissions to be paid to Barclays Capital Inc. or another affiliate of ours, any selling concessions, discounts, commissions or fees (including any structuring or other distribution related fees) to be allowed or paid to non-affiliated intermediaries, the estimated profit that we or any of our affiliates expect to earn in connection with structuring the Notes, the estimated cost which we may incur in hedging our obligations under the Notes, and estimated development and other costs which we may incur in connection with the Notes. ● The Estimated Value of Your Notes Might be Lower if Such Estimated Value Were Based on the Levels at Which Our Debt Securities Trade in the Secondary Market\\xa0— The estimated value of your Notes on the Initial Valuation Date is based on a number of variables, including our internal funding rates. Our internal funding rates may vary from the levels at which our benchmark debt securities trade in the secondary market. As a result of this difference, the estimated value referenced above might be lower if such estimated value were based on the levels at which our benchmark debt securities trade in the secondary market. ● The Estimated Value of the Notes is Based on Our Internal Pricing Models, Which May Prove to be Inaccurate and May be Different from the Pricing Models of Other Financial Institutions\\xa0— The estimated value of your Notes on the Initial Valuation Date is based on our internal pricing models, which take into account a number of variables and are based on a number of subjective assumptions, which may or may not materialize. These variables and assumptions are not evaluated or verified on an independent basis. Further, our pricing models may be different from other financial institutions’ pricing models and the methodologies used by us to estimate the value of the Notes may not be consistent with those of other financial institutions which may be purchasers or sellers of Notes in the secondary market. As a result, the secondary market price of your Notes may be materially different from the estimated value of the Notes determined by reference to our internal pricing models. ● The Estimated Value of Your Notes Is Not a Prediction of the Prices at Which You May Sell Your Notes in the Secondary Market, if any, and Such Secondary Market Prices, If Any, Will Likely be Lower Than the Initial Issue Price of Your Notes and May be Lower Than the Estimated Value of Your Notes\\xa0— The estimated value of the Notes will not be a prediction of the prices at which Barclays Capital Inc., other affiliates of ours or third parties may be willing to purchase the Notes from you in secondary market transactions (if they are willing to purchase, which they are not obligated to do). The price at which you may be able to sell your Notes in the secondary market at any time will be influenced by many factors that cannot be predicted, such as market conditions, and any bid and ask spread for similar sized trades, and may be substantially less than our estimated value of the Notes. Further, as secondary market prices of your Notes take into account the levels at which our debt securities trade in the secondary market, and do not take into account our various costs related to the Notes such as fees, commissions, discounts, and the costs of hedging our obligations under the Notes, secondary market prices of your Notes will likely be lower than the initial issue price of your Notes. As a result, the price at which Barclays Capital Inc., other affiliates of ours or third parties may be willing to purchase the Notes from you in secondary market transactions, if any, will likely be lower than the price you paid for your Notes, and any sale prior to the Maturity Date could result in a substantial loss to you. ● The Temporary Price at Which We May Initially Buy The Notes in the Secondary Market And the Value We May Initially Use for Customer Account Statements, If We Provide Any Customer Account Statements At All, May Not Be Indicative of Future Prices of Your Notes — Assuming that all relevant factors remain constant after the Initial Valuation Date, the price at which Barclays Capital Inc. may initially buy or sell the Notes in the secondary market (if Barclays Capital Inc. makes a market in the Notes, which it is not obligated to do) and the value that we may initially use for customer account PS—15 statements, if we provide any customer account statements at all, may exceed our estimated value of the Notes on the Initial Valuation Date, as well as the secondary market value of the Notes, for a temporary period after the initial Issue Date of the Notes. The price at which Barclays Capital Inc. may initially buy or sell the Notes in the secondary market and the value that we may initially use for customer account statements may not be indicative of future prices of your Notes. ● Lack of Liquidity\\xa0— The Notes will not be listed on any securities exchange. Barclays Capital Inc. and other affiliates of Barclays Bank PLC intend to make a secondary market for the Notes but are not required to do so, and may discontinue any such secondary market making at any time, without notice. Barclays Capital Inc. may at any time hold unsold inventory, which may inhibit the development of a secondary market for the Notes. Even if there is a secondary market, it may not provide enough liquidity to allow you to trade or sell the Notes easily. Because other dealers are not likely to make a secondary market for the Notes, the price at which you may be able to trade your Notes is likely to depend on the price, if any, at which Barclays Capital Inc. and other affiliates of Barclays Bank PLC are willing to buy the Notes. The Notes are not designed to be short-term trading instruments. Accordingly, you should be willing and able to hold your Notes to maturity. ● Many Economic and Market Factors Will Impact the Value of the Notes\\xa0— The value of the Notes will be affected by a number of economic and market factors that interact in complex and unpredictable ways and that may either offset or magnify each other, including: o the market price of, dividend rate on and expected volatility of the Reference Assets or the components of the Reference Assets, if any; o correlation (or lack of correlation) of the Reference Assets; o the time to maturity of the Notes; o interest and yield rates in the market generally; o a variety of economic, financial, political, regulatory or judicial events; o supply and demand for the Notes; and o our creditworthiness, including actual or anticipated downgrades in our credit ratings.

Historical Performance of the Nasdaq-100 Index® PAST PERFORMANCE IS NOT INDICATIVE OF FUTURE RESULTS PS—19 TAX CONSIDERATIONS You should review carefully the sections in the accompanying prospectus supplement entitled “Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences—Tax Consequences to U.S. Holders—Notes Treated as Prepaid Forward or Derivative Contracts with Associated Contingent Coupons” and, if you are a non-U.S. holder, “—Tax Consequences to Non-U.S. Holders.” The following discussion supersedes the discussion in the accompanying prospectus supplement to the extent it is inconsistent therewith. In determining our reporting responsibilities, if any, we intend to treat (i) the Notes for U.S. federal income tax purposes as prepaid forward contracts with associated contingent coupons and (ii) any Contingent Coupon payments as ordinary income, as described in the section entitled “Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences—Tax Consequences to U.S. Holders—Notes Treated as Prepaid Forward or Derivative Contracts with Associated Contingent Coupons” in the accompanying prospectus supplement. Our special tax counsel, Davis Polk & Wardwell LLP, has advised that it believes this treatment to be reasonable, but that there are other reasonable treatments that the Internal Revenue Service (the “IRS”) or a court may adopt. Sale, exchange or redemption of a Note.\\xa0Assuming the treatment described above is respected, upon a sale or exchange of the Notes (including upon early redemption or redemption at maturity), you should recognize capital gain or loss equal to the difference between the amount realized on the sale or exchange and your tax basis in the Notes, which should equal the amount you paid to acquire the Notes (assuming Contingent Coupon payments are properly treated as ordinary income, consistent with the position referred to above). This gain or loss should be short-term capital gain or loss unless you hold the Notes for more than one year, in which case the gain or loss should be long-term capital gain or loss, whether or not you are an initial purchaser of the Notes at the issue price. The deductibility of capital losses is subject to limitations. If you sell your Notes between the time your right to a Contingent Coupon payment is fixed and the time it is paid, it is likely that you will be treated as receiving ordinary income equal to the Contingent Coupon payment. Although uncertain, it is possible that proceeds received from the sale or exchange of your Notes prior to an Observation Date but that can be attributed to an expected Contingent Coupon payment could be treated as ordinary income. You should consult your tax advisor regarding this issue. As noted above, there are other reasonable treatments that the IRS or a court may adopt, in which case the timing and character of any income or loss on the Notes could be materially affected. In addition, in 2007 the U.S. Treasury Department and the IRS released a notice requesting comments on the U.S. federal income tax treatment of “prepaid forward contracts” and similar instruments. The notice focuses in particular on whether to require investors in these instruments to accrue income over the term of their investment. It also asks for comments on a number of related topics, including the character of income or loss with respect to these instruments and the relevance of factors such as the nature of the underlying property to which the instruments are linked. While the notice requests comments on appropriate transition rules and effective dates, any Treasury regulations or other guidance promulgated after consideration of these issues could materially affect the tax consequences of an investment in the Notes, possibly with retroactive effect. You should consult your tax advisor regarding the U.S. federal income tax consequences of an investment in the Notes, including possible alternative treatments and the issues presented by this notice. Non-U.S. holders.\\xa0Insofar as we have responsibility as a withholding agent, we do not currently intend to treat Contingent Coupon payments to non-U.S. holders (as defined in the accompanying prospectus supplement) as subject to U.S. withholding tax. However, non-U.S. holders should in any event expect to be required to provide appropriate Forms W-8 or other documentation in order to establish an exemption from backup withholding, as described under the heading “—Information Reporting and Backup Withholding” in the accompanying prospectus supplement. If any withholding is required, we will not be required to pay any additional amounts with respect to amounts withheld. Treasury regulations under Section 871(m) generally impose a withholding tax on certain “dividend equivalents” under certain “equity linked instruments.” A recent IRS notice excludes from the scope of Section 871(m) instruments issued prior to January 1, 2025 that do not have a “delta of one” with respect to underlying securities that could pay U.S.-source dividends for U.S. federal income tax purposes (each an “Underlying Security”). Based on our determination that the Notes do not have a “delta of one” within the meaning of the regulations, we expect that these regulations will not apply to the Notes with regard to non-U.S. holders. Our determination is not binding on the IRS, and the IRS may disagree with this determination. Section 871(m) is complex and its application may depend on your particular circumstances, including whether you enter into other transactions with respect to an Underlying Security. If necessary, further information regarding the potential application of Section 871(m) will be provided in the pricing supplement for the Notes. You should consult your tax advisor regarding the potential application of Section 871(m) to the Notes. PS—20 SUPPLEMENTAL PLAN OF DISTRIBUTION We will agree to sell to Barclays Capital Inc. (the “Agent”), and the Agent will agree to purchase from us, the principal amount of the Notes, and at the price, specified on the cover of this pricing supplement.

PS—3 CONSENT TO U.K. BAIL-IN POWER Notwithstanding and to the exclusion of any other term of the Notes or any other agreements, arrangements or understandings between us and any holder or beneficial owner of the Notes (or the Trustee on behalf of the holders of the Notes), by acquiring the Notes, each holder and beneficial owner of the Notes acknowledges, accepts, agrees to be bound by, and consents to the exercise of, any U.K. Bail-in Power by the relevant U.K. resolution authority. Under the U.K. Banking Act 2009, as amended, the relevant U.K. resolution authority may exercise a U.K. Bail-in Power in circumstances in which the relevant U.K. resolution authority is satisfied that the resolution conditions are met. These\\xa0conditions include that a U.K. bank or investment firm is failing or is likely to fail to satisfy the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 (the “FSMA”) threshold conditions for authorization to carry on certain regulated activities (within the meaning of section 55B FSMA) or, in the case of a U.K. banking group company that is a European Economic Area (“EEA”) or third country institution or investment firm, that the relevant EEA or third country relevant authority is satisfied that the resolution conditions are met in respect of that entity. The U.K. Bail-in Power includes any write-down, conversion, transfer, modification and/or suspension power, which allows for (i) the reduction or cancellation of all, or a portion, of the principal amount of, interest on, or any other amounts payable on, the Notes; (ii) the conversion of all, or a portion, of the principal amount of, interest on, or any other amounts payable on, the Notes into shares or other securities or other obligations of Barclays Bank PLC or another person (and the issue to, or conferral on, the holder or beneficial owner of the Notes such shares, securities or obligations); (iii) the cancellation of the Notes and/or (iv) the amendment or alteration of the maturity of the Notes, or amendment of the amount of interest or any other amounts due on the Notes, or the dates on which interest or any other amounts become payable, including by suspending payment for a temporary period; which U.K. Bail-in Power may be exercised by means of a variation of the terms of the Notes solely to give effect to the exercise by the relevant U.K. resolution authority of such U.K. Bail-in Power. Each holder and beneficial owner of the Notes further acknowledges and agrees that the rights of the holders or beneficial owners of the Notes are subject to, and will be varied, if necessary, solely to give effect to, the exercise of any U.K. Bail-in Power by the relevant U.K. resolution authority. For the avoidance of doubt, this consent and acknowledgment is not a waiver of any\\xa0rights holders or beneficial owners of the Notes may have at law if and to the extent that any U.K. Bail-in Power is exercised by the relevant U.K. resolution authority in breach of laws applicable in England. For more information, please see “Selected Risk Considerations—Risks Relating to the Issuer—You May Lose Some or All of Your Investment If Any U.K. Bail-in Power Is Exercised by the Relevant U.K. Resolution Authority” in this pricing supplement as well as “U.K. Bail-in Power,” “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to the Securities Generally—Regulatory action in the event a bank or investment firm in the Group is failing or likely to fail, including the exercise by the relevant U.K. resolution authority of a variety of statutory resolution powers, could materially adversely affect the value of any securities” and “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to the Securities Generally—Under the terms of the securities, you have agreed to be bound by the exercise of any U.K. Bail-in Power by the relevant U.K. resolution authority” in the accompanying prospectus supplement. PS—4 ADDITIONAL INFORMATION REGARDING OUR ESTIMATED VALUE OF THE NOTES The range of the estimated values of the Notes referenced above may not correlate on a linear basis with the range of any\\xa0other term of the Notes as may be set forth in this pricing supplement. We determined the size of such range based on prevailing market conditions, as well as the anticipated duration of the marketing period for the Notes. The final terms for the Notes will be determined on the date the Notes are initially priced for sale to the public, which we refer to as the Initial Valuation Date, based on prevailing market conditions on or prior to the Initial Valuation Date, and will be communicated to investors either orally or in a final pricing supplement. Our internal pricing models take into account a number of variables and are based on a number of subjective assumptions, which may or may not materialize, typically including volatility, interest rates, and our internal funding rates. Our internal funding rates (which are our internally published borrowing rates based on variables such as market benchmarks, our appetite for borrowing, and our existing obligations coming to maturity) may vary from the levels at which our benchmark debt securities trade in the secondary market. Our estimated value on the Initial Valuation Date is based on our internal funding rates. Our estimated value of the Notes may be lower if such valuation were based on the levels at which our benchmark debt securities trade in the secondary market. Our estimated value of the Notes on the Initial Valuation Date is expected to be less than the initial issue price of the Notes. The difference between the initial issue price of the Notes and our estimated value of the Notes is a result of several factors, including any sales commissions to be paid to Barclays Capital Inc. or another affiliate of ours, any selling concessions, discounts, commissions or fees (including any structuring or other distribution related fees) to be allowed or paid to non-affiliated intermediaries, the estimated profit that we or any of our affiliates expect to earn in connection with structuring the Notes, the estimated cost which we may incur in hedging our obligations under\\xa0the Notes, and estimated development and other costs which we may incur in connection with the Notes. Our estimated value on the Initial Valuation Date is not a prediction of the price at which the Notes may trade in the secondary market, nor will it be the price at which Barclays Capital Inc. may buy or sell the Notes in the secondary market. Subject to normal market and funding conditions, Barclays Capital Inc. or another affiliate of ours intends to offer to purchase the Notes in the secondary market but it is not obligated to do so. Assuming that all relevant factors remain constant after the Initial Valuation Date, the price at which Barclays Capital Inc. may initially buy or sell the Notes in the secondary market, if any, and the value that we may initially use for customer account statements, if we provide any customer account statements at all, may exceed our estimated value on the Initial Valuation Date for a temporary period expected to be approximately three months after the Issue Date because, in our discretion, we may elect to effectively reimburse to investors a portion of the estimated cost of hedging our obligations under the Notes and other costs in connection with the Notes which we will no longer expect to incur over the term of the Notes. We made such discretionary election and determined this temporary reimbursement period on the basis of a number of factors, which may include the tenor of the Notes and/or any agreement we may have with the distributors of the Notes. The amount of our estimated costs which we effectively reimburse to investors in this way may not be allocated ratably throughout the reimbursement period, and we may discontinue such reimbursement at any time or revise the duration of the reimbursement period after the initial\\xa0Issue Date of the Notes based on changes in market conditions and other factors that cannot be predicted. We urge you to read the “Selected Risk Considerations” beginning on page PS-13\\xa0of this pricing supplement. You may revoke your offer to purchase the Notes at any time prior to the Initial Valuation Date. We reserve the right to change the terms of, or reject any offer to purchase, the Notes prior to the Initial Valuation Date. In the event of any changes to the terms of the Notes, we will notify you and you will be asked to accept such changes in connection with your purchase. You may also choose to reject such changes in which case we may reject your offer to purchase. PS—5 SELECTED PURCHASE CONSIDERATIONS The Notes are not suitable for all investors. The Notes may be a suitable investment for you if all of the following statements are true: ● You do not seek an investment that produces fixed periodic interest or coupon payments or other non-contingent sources of current income, and you can tolerate receiving few or no Contingent Coupons over the term of the Notes in the event the Closing Value of the Reference Asset falls below\\xa0the Coupon Barrier Value on one or more of the specified Observation Dates. ● You understand and accept that you will not participate in any appreciation of the Reference Asset, which may be significant, and that your return potential on the Notes is limited\\xa0to the Contingent Coupons, if any, paid on the Notes. ● You can tolerate a loss of a significant portion or all of the principal amount of your Notes, and you are willing and able to make an investment that may have the full downside market risk of an investment in the Reference Asset. ● You are willing and able to accept the risks associated with receiving shares of the Reference Asset at maturity. ● You do not anticipate that the Closing Value of the Reference Asset will fall below the Coupon Barrier Value on\\xa0any Observation Date or below the Barrier Value on the Final Valuation Date. ● You understand and accept that you will not be entitled to receive dividends or distributions that may be paid to holders of a Reference Asset or any securities to which a\\xa0Reference Asset provides exposure, nor will you have any voting rights with respect to a Reference Asset or any securities to which a Reference Asset provides exposure. ● You understand and accept the risks that (a) you will not receive a Contingent Coupon if the Closing Value of the Reference Asset is less than the Coupon Barrier Value on an Observation Date and (b) you will lose some or all of your principal at maturity if the Final Value of the Reference Asset is less than the Barrier Value. ● You understand\\xa0and accept the risk that, if the Notes are not redeemed prior to scheduled maturity, the payment at maturity, if any, will be based solely on the Reference Asset Return of the Reference Asset. ● You understand and are willing and able to accept the risks associated with an investment linked to the performance of the Reference Asset. ● You are willing and able to accept the risk that the Notes may be redeemed prior to scheduled maturity and that you may not be able to reinvest your money in an alternative investment with comparable risk and yield. ● You can tolerate fluctuations in the price of the Notes prior to scheduled maturity that may be similar to or exceed the downside fluctuations in the value of the Reference Asset. ● You do not seek an investment for which there will be an active secondary market, and you are willing and able to hold the Notes to maturity if the Notes are not redeemed. ● You are willing and able to assume our credit risk for all payments on the Notes. ● You are willing and able to consent to the exercise of any U.K. Bail-in Power by any relevant U.K. resolution authority.

PS—6 ● You prefer the lower risk, and therefore accept the potentially lower returns, of fixed income investments with comparable maturities and credit ratings. ● You are unwilling or unable to assume our credit risk for all payments on the Notes. ● You are unwilling or unable to consent to the exercise of any U.K. Bail-in Power by any relevant U.K. resolution authority. You must rely on your own evaluation of the merits of an investment in the Notes.\\xa0You should reach a decision whether to invest in the Notes after carefully considering, with your advisors, the suitability of the Notes in light of your investment objectives and the specific information set out in this pricing supplement and the documents referenced under “Additional Documents Related to the Offering of the Notes” in this pricing supplement. Neither the Issuer nor Barclays Capital Inc. makes any recommendation as to the suitability of the Notes for investment. PS—7 ADDITIONAL TERMS OF THE NOTES The Observation Dates (including the Final Valuation Date), the Contingent Coupon Payment Dates, any Call Settlement Date and the Maturity Date are subject to postponement in certain circumstances, as described under “Reference Assets—Equity Securities—Market Disruption Events for Securities with an Equity Security as a Reference Asset” and “Terms of the Notes—Payment Dates” in the accompanying prospectus supplement. In addition, the Reference Asset and the Notes are subject to adjustment by the\\xa0Calculation Agent under certain circumstances, as described under “Reference Assets—Equity Securities—Share Adjustments Relating to Securities with an Equity Security as a Reference Asset” in the accompanying prospectus supplement. PS—8 HYPOTHETICAL EXAMPLES OF AMOUNTS PAYABLE UPON AUTOMATIC CALL The following examples demonstrate the hypothetical total return upon an Automatic Call under various circumstances. The “total return” as used in these examples is the number, expressed as a percentage, that results from comparing the aggregate payments per $1,000 principal amount Note to $1,000. The hypothetical total returns set forth below are for illustrative purposes only and may not be the actual total returns applicable to a purchaser of the Notes. The numbers appearing in the following tables and examples have been rounded for ease of analysis. The hypothetical examples below do not take into account any tax consequences from investing in the Notes and make the following key assumption: ■ For each Observation Date that is not also a Call Valuation Date, the Closing Value of the Reference Asset is less than the Coupon Barrier Value. Accordingly, you will NOT\\xa0receive Contingent Coupons on those Observation Dates, unless indicated otherwise below. Example 1: The Notes\\xa0are redeemed on the first Call Valuation Date. Call Valuation Date Is the Closing Value of the Reference Asset Less Than\\xa0the Coupon Barrier Value? Is the Closing Value of the Reference Asset Less Than\\xa0the Call Value? Payment on Contingent Coupon Payment Date\\xa0(per $1,000 principal amount Note) 1 No No $1,036.25 Because the Closing Value of the Reference Asset on the first Call Valuation Date is greater than or equal to the Call Value, the Notes are redeemed and you will receive the Redemption Price on\\xa0the related Call Settlement Date. The Notes will cease to be outstanding after the Call Settlement Date, and you will not receive any further payments on the Notes. The total return on investment of the Notes is 3.625%. Example 2: The Notes are redeemed on\\xa0the\\xa0third Call Valuation Date. Call Valuation Date Is the Closing Value of the Reference Asset Less Than\\xa0the Coupon Barrier Value? Is the Closing Value of the Reference Asset Less Than\\xa0the Call Value? Payment on Contingent Coupon Payment Date\\xa0(per $1,000\\xa0principal amount Note) 1 No Yes $36.25 2 Yes Yes $0.00 3 No No $1,036.25 Because the Closing Value of the Reference Asset on the third Call Valuation Date is greater than or equal to the Call Value, the Notes are redeemed and you will receive the\\xa0Redemption Price on the related Call Settlement Date. The Notes will cease to be outstanding after the Call Settlement Date, and you will not receive any further payments on the Notes. The total return on investment of the Notes is 7.25%. Example 3: The Notes are redeemed on the final Call Valuation Date. Call Valuation Date Is the Closing Value of the Reference Asset Less Than\\xa0the Coupon Barrier Value? Is the Closing Value of the Reference Asset Less Than\\xa0the Call Value? Payment on Contingent Coupon Payment Date\\xa0(per $1,000 principal amount Note) 1 Yes Yes $0.00 2 - 5 With respect to each Call Valuation Date, Yes With respect to each Call Valuation Date, Yes $0.00 6 No No $1,036.25 PS—9 Because the Closing Value of the\\xa0Reference Asset on the final Call Valuation Date is greater than or equal to the Call Value, the Notes are redeemed and you will receive the Redemption Price on the related Call Settlement Date. Example 3 demonstrates that the Closing Value of the Reference Asset is less than its Coupon Barrier Value on each Observation Date prior to the final Call Valuation Date. Accordingly, no Contingent Coupons are payable on the Notes until the final Call Valuation Date. The Notes will cease to be outstanding after the\\xa0Call Settlement Date, and you will not receive any further payments on the Notes. The total return on investment of the Notes is 3.625%. Each of the examples above demonstrate that the return on the Notes upon an Automatic Call will be limited to the Contingent Coupons, if any, that may be payable on the Notes up to and including the applicable Call Settlement Date. Each of the examples above demonstrate that a Contingent Coupon will be payable on a Contingent Coupon Payment Date only if the Closing Value\\xa0of the Reference Asset is greater than or equal to the Coupon Barrier Value on an Observation Date. If the Closing Value of the Reference Asset on an Observation Date is less than the Coupon Barrier Value, you will not receive a Contingent Coupon on the related Contingent Coupon Payment Date. If the Closing Value of the Reference Asset is less than the Coupon Barrier Value on each Observation Date, you will not receive any Contingent Coupons during the term of the Notes. PS—10 HYPOTHETICAL EXAMPLES OF AMOUNTS PAYABLE AT MATURITY The following table illustrates the hypothetical payment at maturity under various circumstances. The examples set forth below are purely hypothetical and are provided for illustrative purposes only. The numbers appearing in the following\\xa0tables and examples have been rounded for ease of analysis. The hypothetical examples below do not take into account any tax consequences from investing in the Notes and make the following key assumptions: ■ You hold the Notes to maturity, and the Notes are NOT\\xa0redeemed prior to scheduled maturity. ■ Hypothetical\\xa0Initial Value, Coupon Barrier Value, Barrier Value, Physical Delivery Amount and Fractional Share Amount for the Reference Asset are as follows:* Reference Asset Initial Value Coupon Barrier Value Barrier Value Physical Delivery Amount Fractional Share Amount U.S. Bancorp $150.00 $75.00 $75.00 6 shares 0.66667 shares * The hypothetical Initial Value shown above has been chosen for illustrative purposes only and does not represent a likely Initial Value. The hypothetical Coupon Barrier Value, Barrier Value, Physical Delivery Amount and Fractional Share Amount shown in the table above is\\xa0based on such hypothetical Initial Value. The actual Initial Value, Coupon Barrier Value, Barrier Value, Physical Delivery Amount and Fractional Share Amount for the Reference Asset will be determined on the Initial Valuation Date. For information regarding recent values of the Reference Asset, please see “Information Regarding the Reference Asset” in this pricing supplement. Final Value Reference Asset Return Payment at Maturity** $220.00 50.00% $1,000.00 $210.00 40.00% $1,000.00 $195.00 30.00% $1,000.00 $180.00 20.00% $1,000.00 $165.00 10.00% $1,000.00 $150.00 0.00% $1,000.00 $135.00 -10.00% $1,000.00 $120.00 -20.00% $1,000.00 $105.00 -30.00% $1,000.00 $90.00 -40.00% $1,000.00 $75.00 -50.00% $1,000.00 $60.00 -60.00% $400.00 $45.00 -70.00% $300.00 $30.00 -80.00% $200.00 $15.00 -90.00% $100.00 $0.00 -100.00% $0.00 ** per $1,000 principal amount Note, excluding the final Contingent Coupon that may be payable on the Maturity Date, and assumes we do not elect to exercise our\\xa0physical settlement option. For an example demonstrating the amount of shares and cash that you would receive if (a) the Final Value of the Reference Asset is less than the Barrier Value and (b) we elect to exercise our physical settlement option, please see the final example below. The following examples illustrate how the payments at maturity set forth in the table above are calculated: Example 1: The Final Value of the Reference Asset is $210.00. Because the Final Value of the Reference Asset is\\xa0greater than or equal to the Barrier Value, you will receive a payment at maturity of $1,000 per $1,000 principal amount Note that you hold (plus the Contingent Coupon that will otherwise be payable on the Maturity Date). PS—11 Example 2: The Final Value of the\\xa0Reference Asset is $90.00. Because the Final Value of the Reference Asset is greater than or equal to the Barrier Value, you will receive a payment at maturity of $1,000 per $1,000 principal amount Note that you hold (plus the Contingent Coupon that will otherwise be payable on the Maturity Date). Example 3: The Final Value of the Reference Asset is $60.00. Because the Final Value of the Reference Asset is less than the Barrier Value, if we do not elect to exercise our physical settlement option, you will receive a payment at maturity of $400.00 per $1,000 principal amount Note that you hold, calculated as follows: $1,000 + [$1,000 × Reference Asset Return of the Reference Asset] $1,000 + [$1,000 × -60.00%] = $400.00 In addition, because the Final Value of the Reference Asset is less than the Coupon Barrier Value, you will not receive a Contingent Coupon on the Maturity Date. The Applicable Physical Delivery Amount and the Applicable Fractional Share Amount are 6 shares and 0.66667 shares, respectively. Accordingly, if we do elect to exercise our physical settlement option, you will receive on the Maturity Date a total of 6 shares of Reference Asset plus $40.00 in cash. For the avoidance of doubt, if the actual Initial Value of the Reference Asset is greater than $1,000 and we do elect to exercise our physical settlement option, you will not receive any shares of the Reference Asset, rather you will only receive a cash payment on the Maturity Date equivalent to the Fractional Share Amount of the Reference Asset\\xa0multiplied by its Final Value. Example 3 demonstrates that if the Notes are not redeemed prior to scheduled maturity, and if the Final Value is less than the Barrier Value, your investment in the Notes will be fully exposed to the decline of the\\xa0Reference Asset from the Initial Value. If the Notes are not redeemed prior to scheduled maturity, you may lose up to\\xa0100.00% of the principal amount of your Notes. Any payment on the Notes, including the repayment of principal, is subject to the credit risk of Barclays Bank PLC. PS—12 SELECTED RISK CONSIDERATIONS An investment in the Notes involves significant risks. Investing in the Notes is not equivalent to investing directly in the Reference Asset or its components, if any. Some of the risks that apply to an\\xa0investment in the Notes are summarized below, but we urge you to read the more detailed explanation of risks relating to the Notes generally in the “Risk Factors” section of the prospectus supplement. You should not purchase the Notes unless you understand and can bear the risks of investing in the Notes. Risks Relating to the Notes Generally ● Your Investment in the Notes May Result in a Significant Loss — The Notes differ from ordinary debt securities in that the Issuer will not necessarily repay the full principal amount of the Notes at maturity. If the Notes are not redeemed prior to scheduled maturity, and if the Final Value of the Reference Asset is less than the Barrier Value, your Notes will be fully exposed to the decline of the Reference Asset from the Initial Value. You may lose up to\\xa0100.00% of the principal amount of your Notes. ● The Notes Are Subject to Risks Associated with our Physical Settlement Option\\xa0— As described on the cover of this pricing supplement, you may under certain circumstances receive shares of the Reference Asset at maturity. If we exercise our physical settlement option, the market value of the shares that you receive may be less than the amount of the cash payment that you would have received had we not exercised such option because of fluctuations in the value of the Reference Asset between the Final Valuation Date and the Maturity Date. ● Potential Return is Limited to the Contingent Coupons, If Any, and You Will Not Participate in Any Appreciation of The Reference Asset — The\\xa0potential positive return on the Notes is limited to the Contingent Coupons, if any, that may be payable during the term of the Notes. You will not participate in any appreciation in the value of the Reference Asset, which may be significant, even though you will be exposed to the depreciation in the value of the Reference Asset if the Notes are not redeemed and the Final Value of the Reference Asset is less than the Barrier Value. ● You May Not Receive Any Contingent Coupon Payments on the Notes — The Issuer will not necessarily make periodic coupon payments on the Notes. You will receive a Contingent Coupon on a Contingent Coupon Payment Date only if the Closing Value of the Reference Asset on the related Observation Date is greater than or equal to the Coupon Barrier Value. If the Closing Value of the Reference Asset on an Observation Date is less than the Coupon Barrier Value, you will not receive a Contingent Coupon on the related Contingent Coupon Payment Date. If the Closing Value of the Reference Asset\\xa0is less than the Coupon Barrier Value on each Observation Date, you will not receive any Contingent Coupons during the term of the Notes. ● The Notes Are Subject to Volatility Risk — Volatility is a measure of the degree of variation in the price of an asset (or level of an index) over a period of time. The amount of any coupon payments that may be payable under the Notes is based on a number of factors, including the expected volatility of the Reference Asset. The amount of such coupon payments will be paid at a per annum rate that is higher than the fixed rate that we would pay on a conventional debt security of the same tenor and is higher than it otherwise would have been had the expected volatility of the Reference Asset been lower. As volatility of the Reference Asset increases, there will typically be a greater likelihood that (a) the Closing Value of the Reference Asset on one or more Observation Dates will be less than the Coupon Barrier Value and (b) the Final Value of the Reference Asset will be less\\xa0than the Barrier Value. Accordingly, you should understand that a higher coupon payment amount reflects, among other things, an indication of a greater likelihood that you will (a) not receive coupon payments with respect to one or more Observation Dates and/or (b) incur a loss of principal at maturity than would have been the case had the amount of such coupon payments been lower. In addition, actual volatility over the term of the Notes may be significantly higher than the expected volatility at the time\\xa0the terms of the Notes were determined. If actual volatility is higher than expected, you will face an even greater risk that you will not receive coupon payments and/or that you will lose some or all of your principal at maturity for the reasons described above. ● Early Redemption and Reinvestment Risk\\xa0— While the original term of the Notes is as indicated on the cover of this pricing supplement, the Notes may be redeemed prior to maturity, as described above, and the holding period over which you may receive any coupon payments that may be payable under the Notes could be as short as approximately six months. The Redemption Price that you would receive on a Call Settlement Date, together with any coupon payments that you may have received prior to the Call\\xa0Settlement Date, may be less than the aggregate amount of payments that you would have received had the Notes not been redeemed. There is no guarantee that you would be able to reinvest the proceeds from an investment in the Notes in a comparable investment with a similar level of risk in the event the Notes are redeemed prior to the Maturity Date. No additional payments will be due after the relevant Call Settlement Date. The fact that the Notes may be redeemed prior to maturity may also adversely impact your ability to sell your Notes and the price at which they may be sold. ● Any Payment on the Notes Will Be Determined Based on the Closing Values of the Reference Asset on the Dates Specified — Any payment on the Notes will be determined based on the Closing\\xa0Values of the Reference Asset on the dates specified. You will not benefit from any more favorable values of the Reference Asset determined at any other time. ● Contingent Repayment of Any Principal Amount Applies Only at Maturity or upon Any Redemption — You should be willing to hold your Notes to maturity or any redemption. Although the Notes provide for the contingent repayment of the principal amount of your Notes at maturity, provided that the Final Value of the Reference Asset is greater than or equal to the Barrier Value, or upon any redemption, if you sell your Notes prior to such time in the secondary market, if any, you may have PS—13 to sell your Notes at a price that is less than the principal amount even if at that time the value of the Reference Asset\\xa0has increased from the Initial Value. See “Many Economic and Market Factors Will Impact the Value of the Notes” below. ● Owning the Notes is Not the Same as Owning a Reference Asset or Any Securities to which a Reference Asset Provides Exposure — The return\\xa0on the Notes may not reflect the return you would realize if you actually owned a Reference Asset or any securities to which a Reference Asset provides exposure. As a holder of the Notes, you will not have voting rights or rights to receive dividends or other distributions or any other rights that holders of a Reference Asset or any securities to which a Reference Asset provides exposure may have. ● Tax Treatment\\xa0— Significant aspects of the tax treatment of the Notes are uncertain. You should consult your tax advisor about your tax situation. See “Tax Considerations” below. Risks Relating to the Issuer ● Credit of Issuer — The Notes are unsecured and unsubordinated\\xa0debt obligations of the Issuer, Barclays Bank PLC, and are not, either directly or indirectly, an obligation of any third party. Any payment to be made on the Notes, including any repayment of principal, is subject to the ability of Barclays Bank PLC to satisfy its obligations as they come due and is not guaranteed by any third party. As a result, the actual and perceived creditworthiness of Barclays Bank PLC may affect the market value of the Notes, and in the event Barclays Bank PLC were to default on its obligations, you may not receive any amounts owed to you under the terms of the Notes. ● You May Lose Some or All of Your Investment If Any U.K. Bail-in Power Is Exercised by the Relevant U.K. Resolution Authority — Notwithstanding and to the exclusion of any other term of the Notes or any other agreements, arrangements or understandings between Barclays Bank PLC and any holder or beneficial owner of the Notes (or the Trustee on behalf of the holders of the Notes), by acquiring the Notes, each holder and beneficial owner of the Notes acknowledges, accepts, agrees to be bound by, and consents to the exercise of, any U.K. Bail-in Power by the relevant U.K. resolution authority as set forth under “Consent to U.K. Bail-in Power” in this pricing supplement. Accordingly, any U.K. Bail-in Power may be exercised in such a manner as to result in you and other holders and beneficial owners of the Notes losing all or a part of the value of your investment in the Notes or receiving a different security from the Notes, which may be worth significantly less than the Notes and which may have significantly fewer protections than those typically afforded to debt securities. Moreover, the relevant U.K. resolution authority may exercise the U.K. Bail-in Power without providing any advance notice to, or requiring the consent of, the holders and beneficial owners of the Notes. The exercise of any U.K. Bail-in Power by the relevant U.K. resolution authority with respect to the Notes will not be a default or an Event of Default (as each term is defined in the senior debt securities indenture) and the trustee will not be liable for any action that the trustee takes, or abstains from taking, in either case, in accordance with the exercise of the U.K. Bail-in Power by the relevant U.K. resolution authority with respect to the Notes. See “Consent to U.K. Bail-in Power” in this pricing supplement as well as “U.K. Bail-in Power,” “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to the Securities Generally—Regulatory action in the event a bank or investment firm in the Group is failing or likely to fail, including the exercise by the relevant U.K. resolution authority of a variety of statutory resolution powers, could materially adversely affect the value of any securities” and “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to the\\xa0Securities Generally—Under the terms of the securities, you have agreed to be bound by the exercise of any U.K. Bail-in Power by the relevant U.K. resolution authority” in the accompanying prospectus supplement. Risks Relating to the Reference Asset ● Historical Performance of the Reference Asset Should Not Be Taken as Any Indication of the Future Performance of the Reference Asset Over the Term of the Notes — The value of the Reference Asset has fluctuated in the past and may, in the future, experience significant fluctuations. The historical performance of the Reference Asset is not an indication of the future performance of the Reference Asset over the term of the Notes. Therefore, the performance of the Reference Asset over the term of the Notes may bear\\xa0no relation or resemblance to the historical performance of the Reference Asset. ● Single Equity Risk — The value of the Reference Asset can rise or fall sharply due to factors specific to the Reference Asset, such as stock price volatility, earnings, financial conditions, corporate, industry and regulatory developments, management changes and decisions and other events, as well as general market factors, such as general stock market volatility and levels, interest rates and economic and political conditions.\\xa0We urge you to review financial and other information filed periodically with the SEC by the Reference Asset. We have not undertaken any independent review or due diligence of the SEC filings of the Reference Asset or of any other publicly available information regarding the Reference Asset. ● Anti-Dilution Protection Is Limited, and the Calculation Agent Has Discretion to Make Anti-Dilution Adjustments — The Calculation Agent may in its sole discretion make adjustments affecting the amounts payable on the Notes upon the occurrence of certain corporate events (such as stock splits or extraordinary or special dividends) that the Calculation Agent determines have a diluting or concentrative effect on the theoretical value of the Reference Asset. However, the Calculation Agent might not make such adjustments in response to all events that could affect the Reference Asset. The occurrence of any such event and any adjustment made by the Calculation Agent (or a determination by the Calculation Agent not to make any\\xa0adjustment) may adversely affect any amounts payable on the Notes. See “Reference Assets—Equity Securities—Share Adjustments Relating to Securities with an Equity Security as a Reference Asset” in the accompanying prospectus supplement. ● Reorganization Or Other Events Could Adversely Affect the Value of the Notes Or Result in the Notes Being Accelerated — Upon the occurrence of certain reorganization events or a nationalization, expropriation, liquidation, bankruptcy, insolvency or de-listing of the Reference Asset, the Calculation Agent will make adjustments to the Reference PS—14 Asset that may result in payments on the Notes being based on the performance of shares, cash or other assets distributed to holders of the Reference Asset upon the occurrence of such event or, in some cases, the Calculation Agent may accelerate the maturity date for a payment determined by the Calculation Agent. Any of these actions could adversely affect the value of the Reference Asset and, consequently, the value of the Notes. Any amount payable upon acceleration could be significantly less than the amount(s) that would be due on the Notes if they were not accelerated. See “Reference Assets—Equity Securities—Share Adjustments Relating to Securities with an Equity Security as a Reference Asset” in the accompanying prospectus supplement. Risks Relating to Conflicts of Interest ● We and Our Affiliates May Engage in Various Activities or Make Determinations That Could Materially Affect the Notes in Various Ways and Create Conflicts of Interest\\xa0— We and our affiliates play a variety of roles in connection with the issuance of the Notes, as described below. In performing these roles, our and our affiliates’ economic interests are potentially adverse to your interests as an investor in the Notes. In connection with our normal business activities and in connection with hedging our obligations under the Notes, we and our affiliates make markets in and trade various financial instruments or products for our accounts and for the account of our clients and otherwise provide investment banking and other financial services with respect to these financial instruments and products. These financial instruments and products may include securities, derivative instruments or assets that may relate to the Reference Asset or its components, if any. In any such market making, trading and hedging activity, and other financial services, we or our affiliates may take positions or take actions that are inconsistent with, or adverse to, the investment objectives of the\\xa0holders of the Notes. We and our affiliates have no obligation to take the needs of any buyer, seller or holder of the Notes into account in conducting these activities. Such market making, trading and hedging activity, investment banking and other financial services may negatively impact the value of the Notes. In addition, the role played by Barclays Capital Inc., as the agent for the Notes, could present significant conflicts of interest with the role of Barclays Bank PLC, as issuer of the Notes. For example, Barclays Capital Inc. or its representatives may derive compensation or financial benefit from the distribution of the Notes and such compensation or financial benefit may serve as incentive to sell the Notes instead of other investments. Furthermore, we and our affiliates establish the offering price of the Notes for initial sale to the public, and the offering price is not based upon any independent verification or valuation. In addition to the activities described above, we will also act as the Calculation Agent for the Notes. As Calculation Agent, we will determine any values of the Reference Asset and make any other determinations necessary to calculate any payments on the Notes. In making these determinations, the Calculation Agent may be required to make discretionary judgements relating to the Reference Asset, including determining whether a market disruption event has occurred or whether certain adjustments to the Reference Asset or other terms of the Notes are necessary, as further described in the accompanying prospectus supplement. In making these discretionary judgments, our economic interests are potentially adverse to your interests as an investor in the Notes, and any of these determinations may adversely affect any payments on the Notes. Risks Relating to the Estimated Value of the Notes and the Secondary Market ● The Estimated Value of Your Notes is Expected to be Lower Than the Initial Issue Price of Your Notes — The estimated value of your Notes on the Initial Valuation Date is expected to be lower, and may be significantly lower, than the initial issue price of your Notes. The difference between the initial issue price of your Notes and the estimated value of the Notes is a result of certain factors, such as any sales commissions to be paid to Barclays Capital Inc. or another affiliate of ours, any selling concessions, discounts, commissions or fees (including any structuring or other distribution related fees)\\xa0to be allowed or paid to non-affiliated intermediaries, the estimated profit that we or any of our affiliates expect to earn in connection with structuring the Notes, the estimated cost which we may incur in hedging our obligations under the Notes, and estimated development and other costs which we may incur in connection with the Notes. ● The Estimated Value of Your Notes Might be Lower if Such Estimated Value Were Based on the Levels at Which Our Debt Securities Trade in the Secondary Market\\xa0— The estimated value of your Notes on the Initial Valuation Date is based on a number of variables, including our internal funding rates. Our internal funding rates may vary from the levels at which our benchmark debt securities trade in the secondary market. As a result of this difference, the estimated value referenced above might be lower if such estimated value were based on the levels at which our benchmark debt securities trade in the secondary market. ● The Estimated Value of the Notes is Based on Our Internal Pricing Models, Which May Prove to be Inaccurate and May be Different from the Pricing Models of Other Financial Institutions\\xa0— The estimated value of your Notes on the Initial Valuation Date is based on our internal pricing models, which take into account a number of variables and are based on a number of subjective assumptions, which may or may not materialize. These variables and assumptions are not evaluated or verified on an independent basis. Further, our pricing models may be different from other financial institutions’ pricing models and the methodologies used by us to estimate the value of the Notes may not be consistent with those of other financial institutions which may be purchasers or sellers of Notes in the secondary market. As a result, the secondary market price of your Notes may be materially different from the estimated value of the Notes determined by reference to our internal pricing models. PS—15 ● The Estimated Value of Your Notes Is Not a Prediction of the Prices at Which You May Sell Your Notes in the Secondary Market, if any, and Such Secondary Market Prices, If Any, Will Likely be Lower Than the Initial Issue Price of Your Notes and May be Lower Than the Estimated Value of Your Notes — The estimated value of the Notes will not be a prediction of the prices at which Barclays Capital Inc., other affiliates of ours or third parties may be willing to purchase the Notes from you in secondary market transactions (if they are willing to purchase, which they are not obligated to do). The price at which you may be able to sell your Notes in the secondary market at any time will be influenced by many factors that cannot be predicted, such as market conditions, and any bid and ask spread for similar sized trades, and may be substantially less than our estimated value of the Notes. Further, as secondary market prices of your Notes take into account the levels at which our debt securities trade in the secondary market, and do not take into account our various costs related to the Notes such as fees, commissions, discounts, and the costs of hedging our obligations under the Notes, secondary market prices of your Notes will likely be lower than the initial issue price of your Notes. As a result, the price at which Barclays Capital Inc., other affiliates of ours\\xa0or third parties may be willing to purchase the Notes from you in secondary market transactions, if any, will likely be lower than the price you paid for your Notes, and any sale prior to the Maturity Date could result in a substantial loss to you. ● The Temporary Price at Which We May Initially Buy The Notes in the Secondary Market And the Value We May Initially Use for Customer Account Statements, If We Provide Any Customer Account Statements At All, May Not Be Indicative of Future Prices of Your Notes — Assuming that all relevant factors remain constant after the Initial Valuation Date, the price at which Barclays Capital Inc. may initially buy or sell the Notes in the secondary market (if Barclays Capital Inc. makes a market in the Notes, which it is not obligated to do) and the value that we may initially use for customer account statements, if we provide any customer account statements at all, may exceed our estimated value of the Notes on the Initial Valuation Date, as well as the secondary market value of the Notes, for a temporary period after the initial Issue Date of the Notes. The price at which Barclays Capital Inc. may initially buy or sell the Notes in the secondary market and the value that we may initially use for customer account statements may\\xa0not be indicative of future prices of your Notes. ● Lack of Liquidity\\xa0— The Notes will not be listed on any securities exchange. Barclays Capital Inc. and other affiliates of Barclays Bank PLC intend to make a secondary market for the Notes but are not required to do so, and may discontinue any such secondary market making at any time, without notice. Barclays Capital Inc. may at any time hold unsold inventory, which may inhibit the development of a secondary market for the Notes. Even if there is a secondary market, it may not provide enough liquidity to allow you to trade or sell the Notes easily. Because other dealers are not likely to make a secondary market for the Notes, the price at which you may be able to trade your Notes is likely to depend on the price, if any, at which Barclays Capital Inc. and other affiliates of Barclays Bank PLC are willing to buy the Notes. The Notes are not designed to be short-term trading instruments. Accordingly, you should be willing and able to hold your Notes to maturity. ● Many Economic and Market Factors Will Impact the Value of the Notes\\xa0— The value of the Notes will be affected by a number of economic and market factors that interact in complex and unpredictable ways and that may either offset or magnify each other, including: o the market price of, dividend rate on and expected volatility of the Reference Asset or the components of the Reference Asset, if any; o the time to maturity of the Notes; o interest and yield rates in the market generally; o a variety of economic, financial, political, regulatory or judicial events; o supply and demand for the Notes; and o our creditworthiness, including actual or anticipated downgrades in our credit ratings. PS—16 INFORMATION REGARDING THE REFERENCE ASSET We urge you to read the\\xa0following section in the accompanying prospectus supplement: “Reference Assets—Equity Securities—Reference Asset Issuer and Reference Asset Information.” Companies with securities registered under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, which is commonly referred to as the “Exchange Act,” and the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended, which is commonly referred to as the “’40 Act,” are required to periodically file certain financial and other information specified by the SEC. Information provided to or filed with the SEC electronically can be accessed through a website maintained by the SEC. The address of the SEC’s website is http://www.sec.gov. Information provided to or filed with the SEC pursuant to the Exchange Act or the ’40 Act by the company issuing the Reference Asset can be located by reference to the SEC file number specified below. The summary information below regarding the Reference Asset comes from the company’s SEC filings. You are urged to refer to the SEC filings made by the company and to other publicly available information (such as the company’s annual report) to obtain an understanding of the company’s business and financial prospects. The summary information contained below is not designed to be, and should not be interpreted as, an effort to present information regarding the financial prospects of any issuer or any trends, events or other factors that may have a positive or negative influence on those prospects or as an endorsement of any particular company. We have not undertaken any independent review or due diligence of the SEC filings of the issuer of the Reference Asset or of any other publicly available information regarding such issuer. Information from outside sources is not incorporated by reference in, and should not be considered part of, this pricing supplement or any accompanying prospectus or prospectus supplement. We have not undertaken any independent review or due diligence of the SEC filings of the Reference Asset or any other publicly available information\\xa0regarding the Reference Asset. We obtained the historical trading price information with respect to the Reference Asset set forth below from Bloomberg Professional®\\xa0service (“Bloomberg”).

Historical Performance of the Common Stock of U.S. Bancorp PAST PERFORMANCE IS NOT INDICATIVE OF FUTURE RESULTS PS—17 TAX CONSIDERATIONS You should review carefully the sections in the accompanying prospectus supplement entitled “Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences—Tax Consequences to U.S. Holders—Notes Treated as Prepaid Forward or Derivative Contracts with Associated Contingent Coupons” and, if you are a non-U.S. holder, “—Tax Consequences to Non-U.S. Holders.” The following discussion supersedes the discussion in the accompanying prospectus supplement to the extent it is inconsistent therewith. This discussion does not address the U.S. federal income tax consequences of the ownership or disposition of the Reference Asset that you may receive at maturity. You should consult your tax advisor regarding the\\xa0potential U.S. federal tax consequences of the ownership and disposition of the Reference Asset. In determining our reporting responsibilities, if any, we intend to treat (i) the Notes for U.S. federal income tax purposes as prepaid forward\\xa0contracts with associated contingent coupons and (ii) any Contingent Coupon payments as ordinary income, as described in the section entitled “Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences—Tax Consequences to U.S. Holders—Notes Treated as Prepaid Forward or Derivative Contracts with Associated Contingent Coupons” in the accompanying prospectus supplement. Our special tax counsel, Davis Polk & Wardwell LLP, has advised that it believes this treatment to be reasonable, but that there are other reasonable treatments that the Internal Revenue Service (the “IRS”) or a court may adopt. Sale, exchange or redemption of a Note. Assuming the treatment described above is respected, and except as described below, upon a sale or exchange of the Notes (including redemption for cash upon an automatic call or at maturity), you should recognize capital gain or loss equal to the difference between the amount realized on the sale or exchange and your tax basis in the Notes, which should equal the amount you paid to acquire the Notes (assuming Contingent Coupon payments are properly treated as ordinary income, consistent with the position referred to above). This gain or loss should be short-term capital gain or loss unless you hold the Notes for more than one year, in which case the gain or loss should be long-term capital gain or loss, whether or not you are an initial purchaser of the Notes at the issue price. The deductibility of capital losses is subject to limitations. If you sell your Notes between the time your right to a\\xa0Contingent Coupon payment is fixed and the time it is paid, it is likely that you will be treated as receiving ordinary income equal to the Contingent Coupon payment. Although uncertain, it is possible that proceeds received from the sale or exchange of your Notes prior to an Observation Date but that can be attributed to an expected Contingent Coupon payment could be treated as ordinary income. You should consult your tax advisor regarding this issue. If you receive shares of the Reference Asset upon the maturity of your Notes, you should be deemed to have applied the purchase price of your Notes toward the purchase of the shares of the Reference Asset you receive. You should not recognize gain or loss with respect to the shares of the Reference Asset you receive. Instead, assuming Contingent Coupon payments are properly treated as ordinary income, consistent with the position described above, your basis in the shares (including any fractional share) should equal the price you paid to acquire your Notes, and\\xa0that basis should be allocated proportionately among the shares. Your holding period for the Reference Asset should begin on the day after receipt. With respect to any cash received in lieu of a fractional share of the Reference Asset, you should recognize capital gain or loss in an amount equal to the difference between the amount of the cash received and the tax basis allocable to the fractional share. As noted above, there are other reasonable treatments that the IRS or a court may adopt, in which case\\xa0the timing and character of any income or loss on the Notes could be materially affected. In addition, in 2007 the U.S. Treasury Department and the IRS released a notice requesting comments on the U.S. federal income tax treatment of “prepaid forward contracts” and similar instruments. The notice focuses in particular on whether to require investors in these instruments to accrue income over the term of their investment. It also asks for comments on a number of related topics, including the character of income or loss with respect to these instruments and the relevance of factors such as the nature of the underlying property to which the instruments are linked. While the notice requests comments on appropriate transition rules and effective dates, any Treasury regulations or other guidance promulgated after consideration of these issues could materially affect the tax consequences of an investment in the Notes, possibly with retroactive effect. You should consult your tax advisor regarding the U.S. federal income tax consequences of an investment in the Notes, including possible alternative treatments and the issues presented by this notice. Non-U.S. holders. Insofar as we have responsibility as a withholding agent, we do not currently intend to treat Contingent Coupon payments to non-U.S. holders (as defined in the accompanying prospectus supplement) as subject to U.S. withholding tax. However, non-U.S. holders should in any event expect to be required to provide appropriate Forms W-8 or other documentation in\\xa0order to establish an exemption from backup withholding, as described under the heading “—Information Reporting and Backup Withholding” in the accompanying prospectus supplement. If any withholding is required, we will not be required to pay any additional amounts with respect to amounts withheld. Treasury regulations under Section 871(m) generally impose a withholding tax on certain “dividend equivalents” under certain “equity linked instruments.” A recent IRS notice excludes from the scope of Section 871(m) instruments issued prior to January 1, 2025 that do not have a “delta of one” with respect to underlying securities that could pay U.S.-source dividends for U.S. federal income tax purposes (each an “Underlying Security”). Based on our determination that the Notes do not have a “delta of one” within the meaning of the regulations, we expect that these regulations will not apply to the Notes with regard to non-U.S. holders. Our determination is not binding on the IRS, and the IRS may disagree with this determination. Section 871(m) is complex and its application may depend on your particular circumstances, including whether you enter into other transactions with respect to an Underlying Security. If necessary, further information regarding the potential application of Section 871(m) will be provided in the pricing supplement for the Notes. You should consult your tax advisor regarding the potential application of Section 871(m) to the Notes. PS—18 SUPPLEMENTAL PLAN OF DISTRIBUTION We will agree to sell to Barclays Capital Inc. (the “Agent”), and the Agent will agree to purchase from us, the principal amount of the Notes, and at the price, specified on the cover of this pricing supplement.

These conditions include that a U.K. bank or investment firm is failing or is likely to fail to satisfy the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 (the “FSMA”) threshold conditions for authorization to carry on certain regulated activities (within the meaning of section 55B FSMA) or, in the case of a U.K. banking group company that is a European Economic Area (“EEA”) or third country institution or investment firm, that the relevant EEA or third country relevant authority is satisfied that the resolution conditions are met in respect of that entity. The U.K. Bail-in Power includes any write-down, conversion, transfer, modification and/or suspension power, which allows for (i) the reduction or cancellation of all, or a portion, of the principal amount of, interest on, or any other amounts payable on, the Notes; (ii) the conversion of all, or a portion, of the principal amount of, interest on, or any other amounts payable on, the Notes into shares or other securities or other obligations of Barclays Bank PLC or another person (and the issue to, or conferral on, the holder or beneficial owner of the Notes such shares, securities or obligations); (iii) the cancellation of the Notes and/or (iv) the amendment or alteration of the maturity of the Notes, or amendment of the amount of interest or any other amounts due on the Notes, or the dates on which interest or any other amounts become payable, including by suspending payment for a temporary period; which U.K. Bail-in Power may be exercised by means of a variation of the terms of the Notes solely to give effect to the exercise by the relevant U.K. resolution authority of such U.K. Bail-in Power. Each holder and beneficial owner of the Notes further acknowledges and agrees that the rights of the holders or beneficial owners of the Notes are subject to, and will be varied, if necessary, solely to give effect to, the exercise of any U.K. Bail-in Power by the relevant U.K. resolution authority. For the avoidance of doubt, this consent and acknowledgment is not a waiver of any rights holders or beneficial owners of the Notes may have at law if and to the extent that any U.K. Bail-in Power is exercised by the relevant U.K. resolution authority in breach of laws applicable in England. For more information, please see “Selected Risk Considerations—Risks Relating to the Issuer—You May Lose Some or All of Your Investment If Any U.K. Bail-in Power Is Exercised by the Relevant U.K. Resolution Authority” in this pricing supplement as well as “U.K. Bail-in Power,” “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to the Securities Generally—Regulatory action in the event a bank or investment firm in the Group is failing or likely to fail, including the exercise by the relevant U.K. resolution authority of a variety of statutory resolution powers, could materially adversely affect the value of any securities” and “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to the Securities Generally—Under the terms of the securities, you have agreed to be bound by the exercise of any U.K. Bail-in Power by the relevant U.K. resolution authority” in the accompanying prospectus supplement. PS—4 ADDITIONAL INFORMATION REGARDING OUR ESTIMATED VALUE OF THE NOTES The range of the estimated values of\\xa0the Notes referenced above may not correlate on a linear basis with the range of any other term of the Notes as may be set forth in this pricing supplement. We determined the size of such range based on prevailing market conditions, as well as the anticipated duration of the marketing period for the Notes. The final terms for the Notes will be determined on the date the Notes are initially priced for sale to the public, which we refer to as the Initial Valuation Date, based on prevailing market conditions on or prior to the Initial Valuation Date, and will be communicated to investors either orally or in a final pricing supplement. Our internal pricing models take into account a number of variables and are based on a number of subjective assumptions, which may or may not materialize, typically including volatility, interest rates, and our internal funding rates. Our internal funding rates (which are our internally published borrowing rates based on variables such as market benchmarks, our appetite for borrowing, and our existing obligations coming to maturity) may vary from the levels at which our benchmark debt securities trade in the secondary market. Our estimated value on the Initial Valuation Date is based on our internal funding rates. Our estimated value of the Notes may be lower if such valuation were based on the levels at which our benchmark debt securities trade in the secondary market. Our estimated value of the Notes on the Initial Valuation Date is expected to be less than the initial issue price\\xa0of the Notes. The difference between the initial issue price of the Notes and our estimated value of the Notes is a result of several factors, including any sales commissions to be paid to Barclays Capital Inc. or another affiliate of ours, any selling concessions, discounts, commissions or fees (including any structuring or other distribution related fees) to be allowed or paid to non-affiliated intermediaries, the estimated profit that we or any of our affiliates expect to earn in connection with structuring the Notes, the estimated cost which we may incur in hedging our obligations under the Notes, and estimated development and other costs which we may incur in connection with the Notes. Our estimated value on the Initial Valuation Date is not a prediction of the price at which the Notes may trade in the secondary market, nor will it be the price at which Barclays Capital Inc. may buy or sell the Notes in the secondary market. Subject to normal market and funding conditions, Barclays Capital Inc. or another affiliate of ours intends to offer to purchase the Notes in the secondary market but it is not obligated to do so. Assuming that all relevant factors remain constant after the Initial Valuation Date, the price at which Barclays Capital Inc. may initially buy or sell the Notes in the secondary market, if any, and the value that we may initially use for customer account statements, if we provide any customer account statements at all, may exceed our estimated value on the Initial Valuation Date for a temporary period expected to be approximately six months after the Issue Date because, in our discretion, we may elect to effectively reimburse to investors a portion of the estimated cost of hedging our obligations under the Notes and other costs in connection\\xa0with the Notes which we will no longer expect to incur over the term of the Notes. We made such discretionary election and determined this temporary reimbursement period on the basis of a number of factors, which may include the tenor of the Notes and/or any agreement we may have with the distributors of the Notes. The amount of our estimated costs which we effectively reimburse to investors in this way may not be allocated ratably throughout the reimbursement period, and we may discontinue such reimbursement at any time or revise the duration of the reimbursement period after the initial Issue Date of the Notes based on changes in market conditions and other factors that cannot be predicted. We urge you to read the “Selected Risk Considerations” beginning on page PS-14\\xa0of this pricing supplement. You may revoke your offer to purchase the Notes at any time prior to the Initial Valuation Date. We reserve the right to change the terms of, or reject any offer to purchase, the Notes prior to the Initial Valuation Date. In the event of any changes to the terms of the Notes, we will notify you and you will be asked to accept such changes in connection\\xa0with your purchase. You may also choose to reject such changes in which case we may reject your offer to purchase. PS—5 SELECTED PURCHASE CONSIDERATIONS The Notes are not suitable for all investors. The Notes may be a suitable investment for you if all of the following statements are true: ● You do not seek an investment that produces fixed periodic interest or coupon payments or other non-contingent sources of current income, and you can tolerate receiving few or no Contingent\\xa0Coupons over the term of the Notes in the event the Closing Value of any Reference Asset falls below its Coupon Barrier Value on one or more of the specified Observation Dates. ● You understand and accept that you will not participate in any appreciation of\\xa0any Reference Asset, which may be significant, and that your return potential on the Notes is limited to the Contingent Coupons, if any, paid on the Notes. ● You can tolerate a loss of a significant portion or all of the principal amount of your Notes, and\\xa0you are willing and able to make an investment that may have the full downside market risk of an investment in the Least Performing Reference Asset. ● You do not anticipate that the Closing Value of any Reference Asset will fall below its Coupon Barrier Value on any Observation Date or below its Barrier Value on the Final Valuation Date. ● You understand and accept that you will not be entitled to receive dividends or distributions that may be paid to holders of any Reference Asset or any securities to which any Reference Asset provides exposure, nor will you have any voting rights with respect to any Reference Asset or any securities to which any Reference Asset provides exposure. ● You are willing and able to accept the individual market risk of each\\xa0Reference Asset and understand that any decline in the value of one Reference Asset will not be offset or mitigated by a lesser decline or any potential increase in the value of any other Reference Asset. ● You understand and accept the risks that (a) you will not receive a Contingent Coupon if the Closing Value of any Reference Asset is less than its Coupon Barrier Value on an Observation Date and (b) you will lose some or all of your principal at maturity if the Final Value of any Reference Asset is less than its Barrier Value. ● You understand and accept the risk that, if the Notes are not redeemed prior to scheduled maturity, the payment at maturity, if any, will be based solely on the Reference Asset Return of the Least Performing Reference Asset. ● You understand and are willing and able to accept the risks associated with an investment linked to the performance of the Reference Assets. ● You are willing and able to accept the risk that the Notes may be redeemed prior to scheduled maturity and that you may not\\xa0be able to reinvest your money in an alternative investment with comparable risk and yield. ● You can tolerate fluctuations in the price of the Notes prior to scheduled maturity that may be similar to or exceed the downside fluctuations in the values of the\\xa0Reference Assets. ● You do not seek an investment for which there will be an active secondary market, and you are willing and able to hold the Notes to maturity if the Notes are not redeemed. ● You are willing and able to assume our credit risk for all payments on the Notes. ● You are willing and able to consent to the exercise of any U.K. Bail-in Power by any relevant U.K. resolution authority. The Notes may not\\xa0be a suitable investment for you if any of the following statements are true: ● You seek an investment\\xa0that produces fixed periodic interest or coupon payments or other non-contingent sources of current income, and/or you cannot tolerate receiving few or no Contingent Coupons over the term of the Notes in the event the Closing Value of any Reference Asset falls below its Coupon Barrier Value on one or more of the specified Observation Dates. ● You seek an investment that participates in the full appreciation of any or all of the Reference Assets rather than an investment with a return that is limited to the Contingent Coupons, if any, paid on the Notes. ● You seek an investment that provides for the full repayment of principal at maturity, and/or you are unwilling or unable to accept the risk that you may lose some or all of the principal amount of the Notes in the event that the Final Value of the Least Performing Reference Asset falls below its Barrier Value. ● You anticipate that the Closing Value of at least one Reference Asset will decline during the term of the Notes such that the Closing Value of at least one\\xa0Reference Asset will fall below its Coupon Barrier Value on one or more Observation Dates and/or the Final Value of at least one Reference Asset will fall below its Barrier Value. ● You are unwilling or unable to accept the individual market risk of each Reference Asset and/or do not understand that any decline in the value of one Reference Asset will not be offset or mitigated by a lesser decline or any potential increase in the value of any other Reference Asset. ● You do not understand and/or are unwilling\\xa0or unable to accept the risks associated with an investment linked to the performance of the Reference Assets. ● You are unwilling or unable to accept the risk that the negative performance of only one Reference Asset may cause you to not receive Contingent\\xa0Coupons and/or suffer a loss of principal at maturity, regardless of the performance of any other Reference Asset. ● You are unwilling or unable to accept the risk that the Notes may be redeemed prior to scheduled maturity. ● You seek an investment that\\xa0entitles you to dividends or distributions on, or voting rights related to any Reference Asset or any securities to which any Reference Asset provides exposure. PS—6 ● You cannot tolerate fluctuations in the price of the Notes prior to scheduled maturity that may\\xa0be similar to or exceed the downside fluctuations in the values of the Reference Assets. ● You seek an investment for which there will be an active secondary market, and/or you are unwilling or unable to hold the Notes to maturity if the Notes are not redeemed. ● You prefer the lower risk, and therefore accept the potentially lower returns, of fixed income investments with comparable maturities and credit ratings. ● You are unwilling or unable to assume our credit risk for all payments on the Notes. ● You are unwilling or unable to consent to the exercise of any U.K. Bail-in Power by any relevant U.K. resolution authority. You must rely on your own evaluation of the merits of an investment in the Notes.\\xa0You should reach a decision whether to invest in the Notes after carefully considering, with your advisors, the suitability of the Notes in light of your investment objectives and the specific information set out in this pricing supplement and the documents referenced under “Additional Documents Related to the Offering of the Notes” in this pricing supplement. Neither the Issuer nor Barclays Capital Inc. makes any recommendation as to the suitability of the Notes for investment. PS—7 ADDITIONAL TERMS OF THE NOTES The Observation Dates (including the Final Valuation Date), the Contingent Coupon Payment Dates, any Call Settlement Date and the Maturity Date are subject to postponement in certain circumstances, as described under “Reference Assets—Equity Securities—Market Disruption Events for Securities with an Equity Security as a Reference Asset,” “Reference Assets—Least or Best Performing Reference Asset—Scheduled Trading Days and Market Disruption Events for Securities Linked to the Reference Asset with the Lowest or Highest Return in a Group of Two or More Equity Securities, Exchange-Traded Funds and/or Indices of Equity Securities” and “Terms of the Notes—Payment Dates” in the accompanying prospectus supplement. In addition, the Reference Assets and the Notes are subject to adjustment by the Calculation Agent under\\xa0certain circumstances, as described under “Reference Assets—Equity Securities—Share Adjustments Relating to Securities with an Equity Security as a Reference Asset” in the accompanying prospectus supplement. PS—8 HYPOTHETICAL EXAMPLES OF AMOUNTS PAYABLE ON A\\xa0SINGLE CONTINGENT COUPON PAYMENT DATE The following examples demonstrate the circumstances under which you may receive a Contingent Coupon on a hypothetical Contingent Coupon Payment Date. The numbers appearing in these tables are purely hypothetical and are provided for illustrative purposes only. These examples do not take into account any tax consequences from investing in the Notes and make the following key assumptions: ■ Hypothetical\\xa0Initial Value of each Reference Asset: $100.00* ■ Hypothetical\\xa0Coupon Barrier Value for each Reference Asset: $60.00 (60.00% of the hypothetical Initial Value set forth above)* ■ Hypothetical\\xa0Call Value for each Reference Asset: $100.00 (100.00% of the hypothetical Initial Value set forth above)* * The hypothetical Initial Value of $100.00, the hypothetical Coupon Barrier Value of $60.00 and the hypothetical Call Value of $100.00 for each Reference Asset have been chosen for illustrative purposes only and do not represent a likely Initial Value, Coupon Barrier Value or Call Value\\xa0for any Reference Asset. The actual Initial Value for each Reference Asset will be equal to its Closing Value on the Initial Valuation Date and the actual Coupon Barrier Value and Call Value for each Reference Asset will be equal to 60.00% and 100.00%, respectively, of its Initial Value. Example 1: The Closing Value of each Reference Asset is greater than its Coupon Barrier Value on the relevant Observation Date. Reference Asset Closing Value on Relevant Observation Date AAPL $99.00 AMZN $65.00 TSLA $70.00 Because the Closing Value of each Reference Asset is greater than its respective Coupon Barrier Value, you will receive a Contingent Coupon of $16.667 (1.6667% of the principal amount per Note) on the related Contingent Coupon Payment Date. Example 2: The Closing Value of one Reference Asset is greater than its Coupon Barrier Value on the relevant Observation Date and the Closing Value of at least one Reference Asset is less than its Coupon Barrier Value on the relevant Observation Date. Reference Asset Closing Value on Relevant Observation Date AAPL $70.00 AMZN $59.00 TSLA $40.00 Because the Closing Value of at least one Reference Asset is less than its Coupon Barrier Value, you will not receive a Contingent Coupon on the related\\xa0Contingent Coupon Payment Date. Example 3: The Closing Value of each Reference Asset is less than its Coupon Barrier Value on the relevant Observation Date. Reference Asset Closing Value on Relevant Observation Date AAPL $58.00 AMZN $40.00 TSLA $35.00 Because the Closing Value of at least one Reference Asset is less than its Coupon Barrier Value, you will not receive a Contingent Coupon on the related Contingent Coupon Payment Date. Examples 2 and 3 demonstrate that you may not receive a\\xa0Contingent Coupon on a Contingent Coupon Payment Date. If the Closing Value of any Reference Asset is below its Coupon Barrier Value on each Observation Date, you will not receive any Contingent Coupons during the term of the Notes. In each of the examples above, because the Closing Value of at least one Reference Asset is below its Call Value on the relevant Call Valuation Date, the Notes will not be redeemed on such date. The Notes will be redeemed only if the Closing Value of each Reference Asset on any\\xa0Call Valuation Date is greater than or equal to its respective Call Value. PS—9 HYPOTHETICAL EXAMPLES OF AMOUNTS PAYABLE UPON AUTOMATIC CALL The following examples demonstrate the hypothetical total return upon an Automatic Call under various circumstances. The “total return” as used in these examples is the number, expressed as a percentage, that results from comparing the aggregate payments per $1,000 principal amount Note to $1,000. The hypothetical total returns set forth below are for illustrative purposes\\xa0only and may not be the actual total returns applicable to a purchaser of the Notes. The numbers appearing in the following tables and examples have been rounded for ease of analysis. The hypothetical examples below do not take into account any tax consequences from investing in the Notes and make the following key assumption: ■ For each Observation Date that is not also a Call Valuation Date, the Closing Value of at least one Reference Asset is less than its Coupon Barrier Value. Accordingly, you will NOT\\xa0receive Contingent Coupons on those Observation Dates, unless indicated otherwise below. Example 1: The Notes are redeemed on the first Call Valuation Date. Call Valuation Date Is the Closing Value of any Reference Asset Less Than\\xa0its Coupon Barrier Value? Is the Closing Value of any Reference Asset Less Than\\xa0its Call Value? Payment on Contingent Coupon Payment Date\\xa0(per $1,000 principal amount Note) 1 No No $1,016.667 Because the Closing Value of each Reference Asset on the first Call Valuation Date is\\xa0greater than or equal to its Call Value, the Notes are redeemed and you will receive the Redemption Price on the related Call Settlement Date. The Notes will cease to be outstanding after the Call Settlement Date, and you will not receive any further payments on the Notes. The total return on investment of the Notes is 1.6667%. Example 2: The Notes are redeemed on the\\xa0third Call Valuation Date. Call Valuation Date Is the Closing Value of any Reference Asset Less Than\\xa0its Coupon Barrier Value? Is the Closing Value of any Reference Asset Less Than\\xa0its Call Value? Payment on Contingent Coupon Payment Date\\xa0(per $1,000 principal amount Note) 1 No Yes $16.667 2 Yes Yes $0.00 3 No No $1,016.667 Because the\\xa0Closing Value of each Reference Asset on the third Call Valuation Date is greater than or equal to its Call Value, the Notes are redeemed and you will receive the Redemption Price on the related Call Settlement Date. The Notes will cease to be outstanding\\xa0after the Call Settlement Date, and you will not receive any further payments on the Notes. The total return on investment of the Notes is 3.3334%. Example 3: The Notes are redeemed on the final Call Valuation Date. Call Valuation Date Is the Closing Value of any Reference Asset Less Than\\xa0its Coupon Barrier Value? Is the Closing Value of any Reference Asset Less Than\\xa0its Call Value? Payment on Contingent Coupon Payment Date\\xa0(per $1,000 principal amount Note) 1 Yes Yes $0.00 2 - 29 With respect to each\\xa0Call Valuation Date, Yes With respect to each Call Valuation Date, Yes $0.00 30 No No $1,016.667 Because the Closing Value of each Reference Asset on the final Call Valuation Date is greater than or equal to its Call Value, the Notes are\\xa0redeemed and you will receive the Redemption Price on the related Call Settlement Date. Example 3 demonstrates that the Closing Value of at least one Reference Asset is less than its Coupon Barrier Value on each Observation Date prior to the final Call Valuation Date. Accordingly, no Contingent Coupons are payable on the Notes until the final Call Valuation Date. The Notes will cease to be outstanding after the Call Settlement Date, and you will not receive any further payments on the Notes. The total return on investment of the Notes is 1.6667%. Each of the examples above demonstrate that the return on the Notes upon an Automatic Call will be limited to the Contingent Coupons, if any, that may be payable on the Notes up to and including the applicable Call\\xa0Settlement Date. PS—10 Each of the examples above demonstrate that a Contingent Coupon will be payable on a Contingent Coupon Payment Date only if the Closing Value of each Reference Asset is greater than or equal to its respective Coupon Barrier Value on an Observation Date. If the Closing Value of any Reference Asset on an Observation Date is less than its Coupon Barrier Value, you will not receive a Contingent Coupon on the related Contingent Coupon Payment Date. If the Closing Value of any Reference Asset is\\xa0less than its Coupon Barrier Value on each Observation Date, you will not receive any Contingent Coupons during the term of the Notes. PS—11 HYPOTHETICAL EXAMPLES OF AMOUNTS PAYABLE AT MATURITY The following table illustrates the hypothetical payment at\\xa0maturity under various circumstances. The examples set forth below are purely hypothetical and are provided for illustrative purposes only. The numbers appearing in the following table and examples have been rounded for ease of analysis. The hypothetical examples below do not take into account any tax consequences from investing in the Notes and make the following key assumptions: ■ Hypothetical\\xa0Initial Value of each Reference Asset: $100.00* ■ Hypothetical Coupon Barrier Value for each Reference Asset: $60.00\\xa0(60.00% of the hypothetical Initial Value set forth above)* ■ Hypothetical\\xa0Barrier Value for each Reference Asset: $60.00 (60.00% of the hypothetical Initial Value set forth above)* ■ You hold the Notes to maturity, and the Notes are NOT\\xa0redeemed prior to scheduled maturity. * The hypothetical Initial Value of $100.00, the hypothetical Coupon Barrier Value of $60.00 and the hypothetical Barrier Value of $60.00 for each Reference Asset have been chosen for illustrative purposes only and do not represent a likely\\xa0Initial Value, Coupon Barrier Value or Barrier Value for any Reference Asset. The actual Initial Value for each Reference Asset will be equal to its Closing Value on the Initial Valuation Date, and the actual Coupon Barrier Value and Barrier Value for each Reference Asset will each be equal to 60.00% of its Initial Value. For information regarding recent values of the Reference Assets, please see “Information Regarding the Reference Assets” in this pricing supplement.

The following examples illustrate how the payments at maturity set forth in the table above are calculated: Example 1: The Final Value of Reference Asset A is $135.00, the Final Value of Reference Asset B is $130.00 and the Final Value of Reference Asset C is $140.00. Because Reference Asset B has the lowest Reference Asset Return, Reference Asset B is the Least Performing Reference Asset. Because the Final Value of the Least Performing Reference Asset is greater than or equal to its Barrier Value, you will receive a payment at maturity of $1,000 per $1,000 principal amount Note that you hold (plus\\xa0the Contingent Coupon that will otherwise be payable on the Maturity Date). PS—12 Example 2: The Final Value of Reference Asset A is $140.00, the Final Value of Reference Asset B is $90.00 and the Final Value of Reference Asset C is $105.00. Because Reference Asset B has the lowest Reference Asset Return, Reference Asset B is the Least Performing Reference Asset. Because the Final Value of the Least Performing Reference Asset is greater than or equal to its Barrier Value, you will receive a payment at maturity of $1,000 per $1,000 principal amount Note that you hold (plus the Contingent\\xa0Coupon that will otherwise be payable on the Maturity Date). Example 3: The Final Value of Reference Asset A is $135.00, the Final Value of Reference Asset B is $50.00 and the Final Value of Reference Asset C is $110.00. Because Reference Asset B has\\xa0the lowest Reference Asset Return, Reference Asset B is the Least Performing Reference Asset. Because the Final Value of the Least Performing Reference Asset is less than its Barrier Value, you will receive a payment at maturity of $500.00 per $1,000 principal amount Note that you hold, calculated as follows: $1,000 + [$1,000 × Reference Asset Return of the Least Performing Reference Asset] $1,000 + [$1,000 × -50.00%] = $500.00 In addition, because the Final Value of at least one Reference Asset is less than its Coupon Barrier Value, you will not receive a Contingent Coupon on the Maturity Date. Example 3 demonstrates that if the Notes are not redeemed prior to scheduled maturity, and if the Final Value of the Least Performing Reference Asset is less than its Barrier Value, your investment in the Notes will be fully exposed to the decline of the Least Performing Reference Asset from its Initial Value. You will not benefit in any way from the Reference Asset Return of any other Reference Asset being higher than the Reference Asset Return of the Least Performing Reference Asset. If the Notes are not redeemed prior to scheduled maturity, you may lose up to\\xa0100.00% of the principal amount of your Notes. Any payment on the Notes, including the repayment of principal, is subject to the credit risk of Barclays Bank PLC. PS—13 SELECTED RISK CONSIDERATIONS An investment in the Notes involves significant risks. Investing in the Notes is not equivalent to investing directly in the Reference Assets or their components, if any. Some of the risks that apply to an investment in the Notes are summarized below, but we urge you to read the more detailed explanation of risks relating to the Notes generally in the “Risk Factors” section of the prospectus supplement. You should not purchase the Notes unless you understand and can bear the risks of investing in the Notes. Risks Relating to the Notes Generally ● Your Investment in the Notes May Result in a Significant Loss — The Notes differ from ordinary debt securities in that the Issuer will not necessarily repay the full principal amount of the Notes at maturity. If the Notes are not redeemed prior to scheduled maturity, and if the Final Value of the Least Performing Reference Asset is less than its Barrier Value, your Notes will be fully exposed to the decline of the Least Performing Reference Asset from its Initial Value. You may lose up to\\xa0100.00% of the principal amount of your Notes. ● Potential Return is Limited to the Contingent Coupons, If Any, and You Will Not Participate in Any Appreciation of Any Reference Asset\\xa0— The potential positive return on the Notes is limited to the Contingent Coupons, if any, that may be payable during the term of the Notes. You will not participate in any appreciation in the value of any Reference Asset, which may be significant, even though you will be exposed to the depreciation in the value of the Least Performing Reference Asset if the Notes are not redeemed and the Final Value of the Least Performing Reference Asset is less than its Barrier Value. ● You May Not Receive Any Contingent Coupon Payments on the Notes — The Issuer will not necessarily make periodic coupon payments on the Notes. You will receive a Contingent Coupon on a Contingent Coupon Payment Date only if\\xa0the Closing Value of each Reference Asset on the related Observation Date is greater than or equal to its respective Coupon Barrier Value. If the Closing Value of any Reference Asset on an Observation Date is less than its Coupon Barrier Value, you will not receive a Contingent Coupon on the related Contingent Coupon Payment Date. If the Closing Value of at least one Reference Asset is less than its respective Coupon Barrier Value on each Observation Date, you will not receive any Contingent Coupons during the term of the Notes. ● Because the Notes Are Linked to the Least Performing Reference Asset, You Are Exposed to Greater Risks of No Contingent Coupons and Sustaining a Significant Loss of Principal at Maturity Than If the Notes Were Linked to a Single Reference Asset — The risk that you will not receive any Contingent Coupons and lose a significant portion or all of your principal amount in the Notes at maturity is greater if you invest in the Notes as opposed to substantially similar securities that are linked to the performance of a single\\xa0Reference Asset. With multiple Reference Assets, it is more likely that the Closing Value of at least one Reference Asset will be less than its Coupon Barrier Value on the specified Observation Dates or less than its Barrier Value on the Final Valuation Date, and therefore, it is more likely that you will not receive any Contingent Coupons and that you will suffer a significant loss of principal at maturity. Further, the performance of the Reference Assets may not be correlated or may be negatively correlated. The lower the correlation between multiple Reference Assets, the greater the potential for one of those Reference Assets to close below its Coupon Barrier Value or Barrier Value on an Observation Date or the Final Valuation Date, respectively. It is impossible to predict what the correlation among the Reference Assets will be over the term of the Notes. The Reference Assets represent different equity markets. These different equity markets may not perform similarly over the term of the Notes. Although the correlation of the Reference Assets’ performance may change over the term of the Notes, the Contingent Coupon rate is determined, in part, based on the correlation of the Reference Assets’ performance calculated using our internal models at the time when the terms of the Notes are finalized. A higher Contingent Coupon is generally associated with lower correlation of the Reference Assets, which reflects a greater potential for missed Contingent Coupons and for a loss of principal at maturity. ● You Are Exposed to the Market Risk of Each Reference Asset — Your return on the Notes is not linked to a basket consisting of the Reference Assets. Rather, it will be contingent upon the independent performance of each Reference Asset. Unlike an instrument with a return linked to a basket of underlying assets in which risk is mitigated and diversified among all the components of the basket, you will be exposed to the risks related to each Reference Asset. Poor performance by any Reference Asset over the term of the\\xa0Notes may negatively affect your return and will not be offset or mitigated by any increases or lesser declines in the value of any other Reference Asset. To receive a Contingent Coupon, the Closing Value of each Reference Asset must be greater than or equal to its Coupon Barrier Value on the applicable Observation Date. In addition, if the Notes have not been redeemed prior to scheduled maturity, and if the Final Value of any Reference Asset is less than its Barrier Value, you will be exposed to the full decline in the Least Performing Reference Asset from its Initial Value. Accordingly, your investment is subject to the market risk of each Reference Asset. ● The Notes Are Subject to Volatility Risk — Volatility is a measure of the degree of variation in the price of an asset (or level of an index) over a period of time. The amount of any coupon payments that may be payable under the Notes is based on a number of factors, including the expected volatility of the Reference Assets. The amount of such coupon payments will be paid at a per annum rate that is higher than the fixed rate that we would pay on a conventional debt security of the same tenor and is higher than it otherwise would have been had the expected volatility of the Reference Assets been lower. As volatility of a Reference Asset increases, there will typically be a greater likelihood that (a) the Closing Value of that Reference Asset on one or more Observation Dates will be less than its Coupon Barrier Value and (b) the Final Value of that Reference\\xa0Asset will be less than its Barrier Value. PS—14 Accordingly, you should understand that a higher coupon payment amount reflects, among other things, an indication of a greater likelihood that you will (a) not receive coupon payments with respect to one or more\\xa0Observation Dates and/or (b) incur a loss of principal at maturity than would have been the case had the amount of such coupon payments been lower. In addition, actual volatility over the term of the Notes may be significantly higher than the expected volatility at the time the terms of the Notes were determined. If actual volatility is higher than expected, you will face an even greater risk that you will not receive coupon payments and/or that you will lose some or all of your principal at maturity for the reasons described above. ● Early Redemption and Reinvestment Risk — While the original term of the Notes is as indicated on the cover of this pricing supplement, the Notes may be redeemed prior to maturity, as described above, and the holding period over\\xa0which you may receive any coupon payments that may be payable under the Notes could be as short as approximately six months. The Redemption Price that you would receive on a Call Settlement Date, together with any coupon payments that you may have received prior to the Call Settlement Date, may be less than the aggregate amount of payments that you would have received had the Notes not been redeemed. There is no guarantee that you would be able to reinvest the proceeds from an investment in the Notes in a comparable investment with a similar level of risk in the event the Notes are redeemed prior to the Maturity Date. No additional payments will be due after the relevant Call Settlement Date. The fact that the Notes may be redeemed prior to maturity may also\\xa0adversely impact your ability to sell your Notes and the price at which they may be sold. ● Any Payment on the Notes Will Be Determined Based on the Closing Values of the Reference Assets on the Dates Specified — Any payment on the Notes will be determined based on the Closing Values of the Reference Assets on the dates specified. You will not benefit from any more favorable values of the Reference Assets determined at any other time. ● Contingent Repayment of Any Principal Amount Applies Only at Maturity or upon Any Redemption — You should be willing to hold your Notes to maturity or any redemption. Although the Notes provide for the contingent repayment of the principal amount of your Notes at maturity, provided that the Final Value of the Least Performing Reference Asset is greater than or equal to its Barrier Value, or upon any redemption, if you sell your Notes prior to such time in the secondary market, if any, you may have to sell your Notes at a price that is less than the principal amount even if at that\\xa0time the value of each Reference Asset has increased from its Initial Value. See “Many Economic and Market Factors Will Impact the Value of the Notes” below. ● Owning the Notes is Not the Same as Owning Any Reference Asset or Any Securities to which Any Reference Asset Provides Exposure\\xa0— The return on the Notes may not reflect the return you would realize if you actually owned any Reference Asset or any securities to which any Reference Asset provides exposure. As a holder of the Notes, you will not have voting rights or rights to receive dividends or other distributions or any other rights that holders of any Reference Asset or any securities to which any Reference Asset provides exposure may have. ● Tax Treatment — Significant aspects of the tax treatment of\\xa0the Notes are uncertain. You should consult your tax advisor about your tax situation. See “Tax Considerations” below. Risks Relating to the Issuer ● Credit of Issuer — The Notes are unsecured and unsubordinated debt obligations of the Issuer, Barclays Bank PLC, and are not, either directly or indirectly, an obligation of any third party. Any payment to be made on the Notes, including any repayment of principal, is subject to the ability of Barclays Bank PLC to satisfy its obligations as they come due and is not guaranteed by any third party. As a result, the actual and perceived creditworthiness of Barclays Bank PLC may affect the market value of the Notes, and in the event Barclays Bank PLC were to default on its obligations, you may not receive any amounts\\xa0owed to you under the terms of the Notes. ● You May Lose Some or All of Your Investment If Any U.K. Bail-in Power Is Exercised by the Relevant U.K. Resolution Authority — Notwithstanding and to the exclusion of any other term of the Notes or any other agreements, arrangements or understandings between Barclays Bank PLC and any holder or beneficial owner of the Notes (or the Trustee on behalf of the holders of the Notes), by acquiring the Notes, each holder and beneficial owner of the Notes acknowledges, accepts, agrees to be bound by, and consents to the exercise of, any U.K. Bail-in Power by the relevant U.K. resolution authority as set forth under “Consent to U.K. Bail-in Power” in this pricing supplement. Accordingly, any U.K. Bail-in Power may be exercised in such a manner as to result in you and other holders and beneficial owners of the Notes losing all or a part of the value of your investment in the Notes or receiving a different security from the Notes, which may be worth significantly less than the Notes and which may have significantly fewer protections than those typically afforded to debt securities. Moreover, the relevant U.K. resolution authority may exercise\\xa0the U.K. Bail-in Power without providing any advance notice to, or requiring the consent of, the holders and beneficial owners of the Notes. The exercise of any U.K. Bail-in Power by the relevant U.K. resolution authority with respect to the Notes will not be a default or an Event of Default (as each term is defined in the senior debt securities indenture) and the trustee will not be liable for any action that the trustee takes, or abstains from taking, in either case, in accordance with the exercise of the U.K. Bail-in Power by the relevant U.K. resolution authority with respect to the Notes. See “Consent to U.K. Bail-in Power” in this pricing supplement as well as “U.K. Bail-in Power,” “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to the Securities Generally—Regulatory action in the event a bank or investment firm in the Group is failing or likely to fail, including the exercise by the relevant U.K. resolution authority of a variety of statutory resolution powers, could materially adversely affect the value of any securities” and “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to the Securities Generally—Under the terms of the securities, you have agreed to be bound by the exercise of any U.K. Bail-in Power by the relevant U.K. resolution authority” in the accompanying prospectus supplement. PS—15 Risks Relating to the Reference Assets ● Historical Performance of the Reference Assets Should Not Be Taken as Any Indication of the Future Performance of the Reference Assets Over the Term of the Notes — The value of each Reference Asset has fluctuated in\\xa0the past and may, in the future, experience significant fluctuations. The historical performance of a Reference Asset is not an indication of the future performance of that Reference Asset over the term of the Notes. The historical correlation among the Reference Assets is not an indication of the future correlation among them over the term of the Notes. Therefore, the performance of the Reference Assets individually or in comparison to each other over the term of the Notes may bear no relation or resemblance to the historical performance of any Reference Asset. ● Single Equity Risk\\xa0— The values of the Reference Assets can rise or fall sharply due to factors specific to each Reference Asset and its issuer, such as stock price volatility, earnings, financial conditions, corporate, industry and regulatory developments, management changes and decisions and other events, as well as general market factors, such as general stock market volatility and levels, interest rates and economic and political conditions. We urge you to review financial and other information filed periodically with the SEC by the issuers of the Reference Assets. We have not undertaken any independent review or due diligence of the SEC filings of the issuers of the Reference Assets or of any other publicly available information regarding any such issuer. ● Anti-Dilution Protection Is Limited, and the Calculation Agent Has Discretion to Make Anti-Dilution Adjustments — The Calculation Agent may in its sole discretion make adjustments affecting the amounts payable on the Notes upon the occurrence of certain corporate events (such as stock splits or extraordinary or special dividends) that the Calculation Agent determines have a diluting or concentrative effect on the theoretical value of any Reference Asset. However, the Calculation Agent might not make such adjustments in response to all events that could affect any Reference Asset. The occurrence of any such event and any adjustment made by the Calculation Agent (or a determination by the Calculation\\xa0Agent not to make any adjustment) may adversely affect any amounts payable on the Notes. See “Reference Assets—Equity Securities—Share Adjustments Relating to Securities with an Equity Security as a Reference Asset” in the accompanying prospectus supplement. ● Reorganization Or Other Events Could Adversely Affect the Value of the Notes Or Result in the Notes Being Accelerated — Upon the occurrence of certain reorganization events or a nationalization, expropriation, liquidation, bankruptcy, insolvency or de-listing of any Reference Asset, the Calculation Agent will make adjustments to that Reference Asset that may result in payments on the Notes being based on the performance of shares, cash or other assets distributed to holders of that Reference Asset upon\\xa0the occurrence of such event or, in some cases, the Calculation Agent may accelerate the maturity date for a payment determined by the Calculation Agent. Any of these actions could adversely affect the value of any Reference Asset and, consequently, the value of the Notes. Any amount payable upon acceleration could be significantly less than the amount(s) that would be due on the Notes if they were not accelerated. See “Reference Assets—Equity Securities—Share Adjustments Relating to Securities with an Equity Security as a Reference Asset” in the accompanying prospectus supplement. Risks Relating to Conflicts of Interest ● We and Our Affiliates May Engage in Various Activities or Make Determinations That Could Materially Affect the Notes in Various Ways and Create Conflicts of Interest — We and our affiliates play a variety of roles in connection with the issuance of the Notes, as described below. In performing these roles, our and our affiliates’ economic interests are potentially adverse to your interests as\\xa0an investor in the Notes. In connection with our normal business activities and in connection with hedging our obligations under the Notes, we and our affiliates make markets in and trade various financial instruments or products for our accounts and for the account of our clients and otherwise provide investment banking and other financial services with respect to these financial instruments and products. These financial instruments and products may include securities, derivative instruments or assets that\\xa0may relate to the Reference Assets or their components, if any. In any such market making, trading and hedging activity, and other financial services, we or our affiliates may take positions or take actions that are inconsistent with, or adverse to, the investment objectives of the holders of the Notes. We and our affiliates have no obligation to take the needs of any buyer, seller or holder of the Notes into account in conducting these activities. Such market making, trading and hedging activity, investment banking and other financial services may negatively impact the value of the Notes. In addition, the role played by Barclays Capital Inc., as the agent for the Notes, could present significant conflicts of interest with the role of Barclays Bank PLC, as\\xa0issuer of the Notes. For example, Barclays Capital Inc. or its representatives may derive compensation or financial benefit from the distribution of the Notes and such compensation or financial benefit may serve as incentive to sell the Notes instead of other investments. Furthermore, we and our affiliates establish the offering price of the Notes for initial sale to the public, and the offering price is not based upon any independent verification or valuation. In addition to the activities described above,\\xa0we will also act as the Calculation Agent for the Notes. As Calculation Agent, we will determine any values of the Reference Assets and make any other determinations necessary to calculate any payments on the Notes. In making these determinations, the Calculation Agent may be required to make discretionary judgements relating to the Reference Assets, including determining whether a market disruption event has occurred or whether certain adjustments to the Reference Assets or other terms of the Notes are necessary, as further described in the accompanying prospectus supplement. In making these discretionary judgments, our economic interests are potentially adverse to your interests as an investor in the Notes, and any of these determinations may adversely affect any payments on the Notes. PS—16 Risks Relating to the Estimated Value of the Notes and the Secondary Market ● The Estimated Value of Your Notes is Expected to be Lower Than the Initial Issue Price of Your Notes — The estimated value of your Notes on the Initial Valuation Date is expected to be lower, and may be significantly lower, than the initial issue price of your Notes. The difference between the initial issue price of your Notes and the estimated value of the Notes is a result of certain factors, such as any sales commissions to be paid to Barclays Capital Inc. or another affiliate of ours, any selling concessions, discounts, commissions or fees (including any structuring or other distribution related fees) to be allowed or paid to non-affiliated intermediaries, the estimated profit that we or any of our affiliates expect to earn in connection with structuring the Notes, the estimated cost which we may incur in hedging our obligations under the Notes, and estimated development and other costs which we may\\xa0incur in connection with the Notes. ● The Estimated Value of Your Notes Might be Lower if Such Estimated Value Were Based on the Levels at Which Our Debt Securities Trade in the Secondary Market\\xa0— The estimated value of your Notes on the Initial Valuation Date is based on a number of variables, including our internal funding rates. Our internal funding rates may vary from the levels at which our benchmark debt securities trade in the secondary market. As a result of this difference, the estimated value referenced above might be lower if such estimated value were based on the levels at which our benchmark debt securities trade in the secondary market. ● The Estimated Value of the Notes is Based on Our Internal Pricing Models, Which May Prove to be Inaccurate and May be Different from the Pricing Models of Other Financial Institutions — The estimated value of your Notes on the Initial Valuation Date is based on our internal pricing models, which take into account a number of variables and are based on a number of\\xa0subjective assumptions, which may or may not materialize. These variables and assumptions are not evaluated or verified on an independent basis. Further, our pricing models may be different from other financial institutions’ pricing models and the methodologies used by us to estimate the value of the Notes may not be consistent with those of other financial institutions which may be purchasers or sellers of Notes in the secondary market. As a result, the secondary market price of your Notes may be materially different from the estimated value of the Notes determined by reference to our internal pricing models. ● The Estimated Value of Your Notes Is Not a Prediction of the Prices at Which You May Sell Your Notes in the Secondary Market, if any, and Such Secondary Market Prices, If Any, Will Likely be Lower Than the Initial Issue Price of Your Notes and May be Lower Than the Estimated Value of Your Notes\\xa0— The estimated value of the Notes will not be a prediction of the prices at which Barclays Capital Inc., other affiliates of ours or third parties may be willing to purchase the Notes from you in secondary market transactions (if they are willing to purchase, which they are not obligated to do). The price at which you may be able to sell your Notes in the secondary market at any time will be influenced by many factors that cannot be predicted, such as market conditions, and any bid and ask spread for similar sized trades, and may be substantially less than our estimated value of the Notes. Further, as secondary market prices of your Notes take into account the levels at which our debt securities trade in the secondary market, and do not take into account our various costs related to the Notes such as fees, commissions, discounts, and the costs of hedging our obligations under the Notes, secondary market prices of your Notes will likely be lower than the initial issue price of your Notes. As a result, the price at which Barclays Capital Inc., other affiliates of ours or third parties may be willing to purchase the Notes from you in secondary market transactions, if any, will likely be lower than the price you paid for your Notes, and any sale prior to the Maturity Date could result in a substantial loss to you. ● The Temporary Price at Which We May Initially Buy The Notes in the Secondary Market And the Value We May Initially Use for Customer Account Statements, If We Provide Any Customer Account Statements At All, May Not Be Indicative of Future Prices of Your Notes\\xa0— Assuming that all relevant factors remain constant after the Initial Valuation Date, the price at which Barclays Capital Inc. may initially buy or sell the Notes in the secondary market (if Barclays Capital Inc. makes a market in the Notes, which it is not obligated to do) and the value that we may initially use for customer account statements, if we provide any customer account statements at all, may exceed our estimated value of the Notes on the Initial Valuation Date, as well as the secondary market value of the Notes, for a temporary period after the initial Issue Date of the Notes. The price at which Barclays Capital Inc. may initially buy or sell the Notes in the secondary market and the value that we may initially use for customer account statements may not be indicative of future prices of your Notes. ● Lack of Liquidity\\xa0— The Notes will not be listed on any securities exchange. Barclays Capital Inc. and other affiliates of Barclays Bank PLC intend to make a secondary market for the Notes but are not required to do so, and may discontinue any such secondary market making at any time, without notice. Barclays Capital Inc. may at any time hold unsold inventory, which may inhibit the development of a secondary market for the Notes. Even if there is a secondary market, it may not provide enough liquidity to allow you to trade or sell the Notes easily. Because other dealers are not likely to make a secondary market for the Notes, the price at which you may be able to trade your Notes is likely to depend on the price, if any, at which Barclays Capital Inc. and other affiliates of Barclays Bank PLC are willing to buy the Notes. The Notes are not designed to be short-term trading instruments. Accordingly, you should be willing and able to hold your Notes to maturity. ● Many Economic and Market Factors Will Impact the Value of the Notes\\xa0— The value of the Notes will be affected by a number of economic and market factors that interact in complex and unpredictable ways and that may either offset or magnify each other, including: o the market price of, dividend rate on and\\xa0expected volatility of the Reference Assets or the components of the Reference Assets, if any; o correlation (or lack of correlation) of the Reference Assets; PS—17 o the time to maturity of the Notes; o interest and yield rates in the market generally; o a\\xa0variety of economic, financial, political, regulatory or judicial events; o supply and demand for the Notes; and o our creditworthiness, including actual or anticipated downgrades in our credit ratings. PS—18 INFORMATION REGARDING THE REFERENCE ASSETS We urge\\xa0you to read the following section in the accompanying prospectus supplement: “Reference Assets—Equity Securities—Reference Asset Issuer and Reference Asset Information.” Companies with securities registered under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, which is commonly referred to as the “Exchange Act,” and the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended, which is commonly referred to as the “’40 Act,” are required to periodically file certain financial and other information specified by the SEC. Information provided to or filed with the SEC electronically can be accessed through a website maintained by the SEC. The address of the SEC’s website is http://www.sec.gov. Information provided to or filed with the SEC pursuant to the Exchange Act or the ’40 Act by the company issuing each Reference Asset can be located by reference to the SEC file number specified below. The summary information below regarding each Reference Asset comes from each company’s respective SEC filings. You are urged to refer to\\xa0the SEC filings made by the company and to other publicly available information (such as the company’s annual report) to obtain an understanding of the company’s business and financial prospects. The summary information contained below is not designed to be, and should not be interpreted as, an effort to present information regarding the financial prospects of any issuer or any trends, events or other factors that may have a positive or negative influence on those prospects or as an endorsement of any particular company. We have not undertaken any independent review or due diligence of the SEC filings of the issuer of any of the Reference Assets or of any other publicly available information regarding each such issuer.

Historical Performance of the Common Stock of Tesla, Inc. PAST PERFORMANCE IS NOT INDICATIVE OF FUTURE RESULTS PS—21 TAX CONSIDERATIONS You should review carefully the sections in the accompanying prospectus supplement entitled “Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences—Tax Consequences to U.S. Holders—Notes Treated as Prepaid Forward or Derivative Contracts with Associated Contingent Coupons” and, if you are a non-U.S. holder, “—Tax Consequences to Non-U.S. Holders.” The following discussion supersedes the discussion in the accompanying prospectus supplement to the extent it is inconsistent therewith. In determining our reporting responsibilities, if any, we intend to treat (i) the Notes for U.S. federal income tax purposes as prepaid forward contracts with associated contingent coupons and (ii) any Contingent Coupon payments as ordinary income, as described in the section entitled “Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences—Tax Consequences to U.S. Holders—Notes Treated as Prepaid Forward or Derivative Contracts with Associated Contingent Coupons” in the accompanying prospectus supplement. Our special tax counsel, Davis Polk & Wardwell LLP, has advised that it believes this treatment to be reasonable, but that there are other reasonable treatments that the Internal Revenue Service (the “IRS”) or a court may adopt. Sale, exchange or redemption of a Note. Assuming the treatment described above is respected, upon a sale or exchange of the Notes (including redemption upon an automatic call or at maturity), you should recognize capital gain or loss equal to the difference between the amount realized on the sale or exchange and your tax basis in the Notes, which should equal the amount you paid to acquire the Notes (assuming Contingent Coupon payments are properly treated as ordinary income, consistent with the position\\xa0referred to above). This gain or loss should be short-term capital gain or loss unless you hold the Notes for more than one year, in which case the gain or loss should be long-term capital gain or loss, whether or not you are an initial purchaser of the Notes at the issue price. The deductibility of capital losses is subject to limitations. If you sell your Notes between the time your right to a Contingent Coupon payment is fixed and the time it is paid, it is likely that you will be treated as receiving ordinary income equal to the Contingent Coupon payment. Although uncertain, it is possible that proceeds received from the sale or exchange of your Notes prior to an Observation Date but that can be attributed to an expected Contingent Coupon payment could be treated as ordinary income. You should consult your tax advisor regarding this issue. As noted above, there are other reasonable treatments that the IRS or a court may adopt, in which case the timing and character of any income or loss on the Notes could be materially affected. In addition, in 2007 the U.S. Treasury Department and the IRS released a notice requesting comments on the U.S. federal income tax treatment of “prepaid forward contracts” and similar instruments. The notice focuses in particular on whether to require investors in these instruments to accrue income over the term of their investment. It also asks for comments on a number of related topics, including the character of income or loss with respect to these instruments and the relevance of factors such as the nature of the underlying property to which the instruments are linked. While the notice requests comments on appropriate transition rules and effective dates, any Treasury regulations or other guidance promulgated after consideration\\xa0of these issues could materially affect the tax consequences of an investment in the Notes, possibly with retroactive effect. You should consult your tax advisor regarding the U.S. federal income tax consequences of an investment in the Notes, including possible alternative treatments and the issues presented by this notice. Non-U.S. holders.\\xa0Insofar as we have responsibility as a withholding agent, we do not currently intend to treat Contingent Coupon payments to non-U.S. holders (as defined in the accompanying prospectus supplement) as subject to U.S. withholding tax. However, non-U.S. holders should in any event expect to be required to provide appropriate Forms W-8 or other documentation in order to establish an exemption from backup withholding, as described under the heading “—Information Reporting and Backup Withholding” in the accompanying prospectus supplement. If any withholding is required, we will not be required to pay any additional amounts with respect to amounts withheld. Treasury regulations under Section 871(m) generally impose a withholding tax on certain “dividend equivalents” under certain “equity linked instruments.” A recent IRS notice excludes from the scope of Section 871(m) instruments issued prior to January 1, 2025 that do not have\\xa0a “delta of one” with respect to underlying securities that could pay U.S.-source dividends for U.S. federal income tax purposes (each an “Underlying Security”). Based on our determination that the Notes do not have a “delta of one” within the meaning of the regulations, we expect that these regulations will not apply to the Notes with regard to non-U.S. holders. Our determination is not binding on the IRS, and the IRS may disagree with this determination. Section 871(m) is complex and its application may depend on your particular circumstances, including whether you enter into other transactions with respect to an Underlying Security. If necessary, further information regarding the potential application of Section 871(m) will be provided in the pricing supplement for the Notes. You should consult your tax advisor regarding the potential application of Section 871(m) to the Notes. PS—22 SUPPLEMENTAL PLAN OF DISTRIBUTION We will agree to sell to Barclays Capital Inc. (the “Agent”), and the Agent will agree to purchase from us, the principal amount of the Notes, and at the price, specified on the cover of this pricing supplement. The Agent will commit to take and pay for all of the Notes, if any are taken.

This pricing supplement, together with the documents listed below, contains the terms of the Notes and supersedes all prior or contemporaneous oral\\xa0statements as well as any other written materials including preliminary or indicative pricing terms, correspondence, trade ideas, structures for implementation, sample structures, brochures or other educational materials of ours. You should carefully consider, among other things, the matters set forth under “Risk Factors” in the prospectus supplement and “Selected Risk Considerations” in this pricing supplement, as the Notes involve risks not associated with conventional debt securities. We urge you to consult your investment, legal, tax, accounting and other advisors before you invest in the Notes. You may access these documents on the SEC website at www.sec.gov as follows (or if such address has changed, by reviewing our filings for the relevant date on the SEC website): ● Prospectus dated May 23, 2022: http://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/312070/000119312522157585/d337542df3asr.htm ● Prospectus Supplement dated June 27, 2022: http://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0000312070/000095010322011301/dp169388_424b2-prosupp.htm Our SEC file number is 1—10257.

PS—3 CONSENT TO U.K. BAIL-IN POWER Notwithstanding and to the exclusion of any other term of the Notes or any other agreements, arrangements or understandings between us and any holder or beneficial owner of the Notes (or the Trustee on behalf of the holders of the Notes), by acquiring the Notes, each holder and beneficial owner of the Notes acknowledges, accepts, agrees to be bound by,\\xa0and consents to the exercise of, any U.K. Bail-in Power by the relevant U.K. resolution authority. Under the U.K. Banking Act 2009, as amended, the relevant U.K. resolution authority may exercise a U.K. Bail-in Power in circumstances in which the relevant\\xa0U.K. resolution authority is satisfied that the resolution conditions are met. These conditions include that a U.K. bank or investment firm is failing or is likely to fail to satisfy the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 (the “FSMA”) threshold conditions for authorization to carry on certain regulated activities (within the meaning of section 55B FSMA) or, in the case of a U.K. banking group company that is a European Economic Area (“EEA”) or third country institution or investment firm, that the relevant EEA or third country relevant authority is satisfied that the resolution conditions are met in respect of that entity. The U.K. Bail-in Power includes any write-down, conversion, transfer, modification and/or suspension power, which allows for (i) the reduction or cancellation of all, or a portion, of the principal amount of, interest on, or any other amounts payable on, the Notes; (ii) the conversion of all, or a portion, of the principal amount of, interest on, or any other amounts payable on, the Notes into shares or other securities or other obligations of Barclays Bank PLC or another person (and the issue to, or conferral on, the holder or beneficial owner of the Notes such shares, securities or obligations); (iii) the cancellation of the Notes and/or (iv) the amendment or alteration of the maturity of the Notes, or amendment of the amount of interest or any other amounts due on the Notes, or the dates on which interest or any other amounts become payable, including by suspending payment for a temporary period; which U.K. Bail-in Power may be exercised by means of a variation of the terms of the Notes solely to give effect to the exercise by the relevant U.K. resolution authority of such U.K. Bail-in Power. Each holder and beneficial owner of the Notes further acknowledges and agrees that the rights of the holders or beneficial owners of the Notes are subject to, and will be varied, if necessary, solely to give effect to, the exercise of any U.K. Bail-in Power by the relevant U.K. resolution authority. For the avoidance of doubt, this consent and acknowledgment is not a waiver of any rights holders or beneficial owners of the Notes may have at law if and to the extent that any U.K. Bail-in Power is exercised by the relevant U.K. resolution authority in breach of laws applicable in England. For more information, please see “Selected Risk Considerations—Risks Relating to the Issuer—You May Lose Some or All of Your Investment If Any U.K. Bail-in Power Is Exercised by the Relevant U.K. Resolution Authority” in this pricing supplement as well as “U.K. Bail-in Power,” “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to the Securities Generally—Regulatory action in the event a bank or investment firm in the Group is failing or likely to fail, including the exercise by the relevant U.K. resolution authority of a variety of statutory resolution powers, could materially adversely affect the value of any securities” and “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to the Securities Generally—Under the terms of the securities, you have agreed to be bound by the exercise of any U.K. Bail-in Power by the relevant U.K. resolution authority” in the accompanying prospectus supplement. PS—4 ADDITIONAL INFORMATION REGARDING OUR ESTIMATED VALUE OF THE NOTES The range of the estimated values of\\xa0the Notes referenced above may not correlate on a linear basis with the range of any other term of the Notes as may be set forth in this pricing supplement. We determined the size of such range based on prevailing market conditions, as well as the anticipated duration of the marketing period for the Notes. The final terms for the Notes will be determined on the date the Notes are initially priced for sale to the public, which we refer to as the Initial Valuation Date, based on prevailing market conditions on or prior to the Initial Valuation Date, and will be communicated to investors either orally or in a final pricing supplement. Our internal pricing models take into account a number of variables and are based on a number of subjective assumptions, which may or may not materialize, typically including volatility, interest rates, and our internal funding rates. Our internal funding rates (which are our internally published borrowing rates based on variables such as market benchmarks, our appetite for borrowing, and our existing obligations coming to maturity) may vary from the levels at which our benchmark debt securities trade in the secondary market. Our estimated value on the Initial Valuation Date is based on our internal funding rates. Our estimated value of the Notes may be lower if such valuation were based on the levels at which our benchmark debt securities trade in the secondary market. Our estimated value of the Notes on the Initial Valuation Date is expected to be less than the initial issue price\\xa0of the Notes. The difference between the initial issue price of the Notes and our estimated value of the Notes is a result of several factors, including any sales commissions to be paid to Barclays Capital Inc. or another affiliate of ours, any selling concessions, discounts, commissions or fees (including any structuring or other distribution related fees) to be allowed or paid to non-affiliated intermediaries, the estimated profit that we or any of our affiliates expect to earn in connection with structuring the Notes, the estimated cost which we may incur in hedging our obligations under the Notes, and estimated development and other costs which we may incur in connection with the Notes. Our estimated value on the Initial Valuation Date is not a prediction of the price at which the Notes may trade in the secondary market, nor will it be the price at which Barclays Capital Inc. may buy or sell the Notes in the secondary market. Subject to normal market and funding conditions, Barclays Capital Inc. or another affiliate of ours intends to offer to purchase the Notes in the secondary market but it is not obligated to do so. Assuming that all relevant factors remain constant after the Initial Valuation Date, the price at which Barclays Capital Inc. may initially buy or sell the Notes in the secondary market, if any, and the value that we may initially use for customer account statements, if we provide any customer account statements at all, may exceed our estimated value on the Initial Valuation Date for a temporary period expected to be approximately six months after the Issue Date because, in our discretion, we may elect to effectively reimburse to investors a portion of the estimated cost of hedging our obligations under the Notes and other costs in connection\\xa0with the Notes which we will no longer expect to incur over the term of the Notes. We made such discretionary election and determined this temporary reimbursement period on the basis of a number of factors, which may include the tenor of the Notes and/or any agreement we may have with the distributors of the Notes. The amount of our estimated costs which we effectively reimburse to investors in this way may not be allocated ratably throughout the reimbursement period, and we may discontinue such reimbursement at any time or revise the duration of the reimbursement period after the initial Issue Date of the Notes based on changes in market conditions and other factors that cannot be predicted. We urge you to read the “Selected Risk Considerations” beginning on page PS-14\\xa0of this pricing supplement. You may revoke your offer to purchase the Notes at any time prior to the Initial Valuation Date. We reserve the right to change the terms of, or reject any offer to purchase, the Notes prior to the Initial Valuation Date. In the event of any changes to the terms of the Notes, we will notify you and you will be asked to accept such changes in connection\\xa0with your purchase. You may also choose to reject such changes in which case we may reject your offer to purchase. PS—5 SELECTED PURCHASE CONSIDERATIONS The Notes are not suitable for all investors. The Notes may be a suitable investment for you if all of the following statements are true: ● You do not seek an investment that produces fixed periodic interest or coupon payments or other non-contingent sources of current income, and you can tolerate receiving few or no Contingent\\xa0Coupons over the term of the Notes in the event the Closing Value of any Reference Asset falls below its Coupon Barrier Value on one or more of the specified Observation Dates. ● You understand and accept that you will not participate in any appreciation of\\xa0any Reference Asset, which may be significant, and that your return potential on the Notes is limited to the Contingent Coupons, if any, paid on the Notes. ● You can tolerate a loss of a significant portion or all of the principal amount of your Notes, and\\xa0you are willing and able to make an investment that may have the full downside market risk of an investment in the Least Performing Reference Asset. ● You do not anticipate that the Closing Value of any Reference Asset will fall below its Coupon Barrier Value on any Observation Date or below its Barrier Value on the Final Valuation Date. ● You understand and accept that you will not be entitled to receive dividends or distributions that may be paid to holders of any Reference Asset or any securities to which any Reference Asset provides exposure, nor will you have any voting rights with respect to any Reference Asset or any securities to which any Reference Asset provides exposure. ● You are willing and able to accept the individual market risk of each\\xa0Reference Asset and understand that any decline in the value of one Reference Asset will not be offset or mitigated by a lesser decline or any potential increase in the value of any other Reference Asset. ● You understand and accept the risks that (a) you will not receive a Contingent Coupon if the Closing Value of any Reference Asset is less than its Coupon Barrier Value on an Observation Date and (b) you will lose some or all of your principal at maturity if the Final Value of any Reference Asset is less than its Barrier Value. ● You understand and accept the risk that, if the Notes are not redeemed prior to scheduled maturity, the payment at maturity, if any, will be based solely on the Reference Asset Return of the Least Performing Reference Asset. ● You understand and are willing and able to accept the risks associated with an investment linked to the performance of the Reference Assets. ● You are willing and able to accept the risk that the Notes may be redeemed prior to scheduled maturity and that you may not\\xa0be able to reinvest your money in an alternative investment with comparable risk and yield. ● You can tolerate fluctuations in the price of the Notes prior to scheduled maturity that may be similar to or exceed the downside fluctuations in the values of the\\xa0Reference Assets. ● You do not seek an investment for which there will be an active secondary market, and you are willing and able to hold the Notes to maturity if the Notes are not redeemed. ● You are willing and able to assume our credit risk for all payments on the Notes. ● You are willing and able to consent to the exercise of any U.K. Bail-in Power by any relevant U.K. resolution authority. The Notes may not\\xa0be a suitable investment for you if any of the following statements are true: ● You seek an investment\\xa0that produces fixed periodic interest or coupon payments or other non-contingent sources of current income, and/or you cannot tolerate receiving few or no Contingent Coupons over the term of the Notes in the event the Closing Value of any Reference Asset falls below its Coupon Barrier Value on one or more of the specified Observation Dates. ● You seek an investment that participates in the full appreciation of any or all of the Reference Assets rather than an investment with a return that is limited to the Contingent Coupons, if any, paid on the Notes. ● You seek an investment that provides for the full repayment of principal at maturity, and/or you are unwilling or unable to accept the risk that you may lose some or all of the principal amount of the Notes in the event that the Final Value of the Least Performing Reference Asset falls below its Barrier Value. ● You anticipate that the Closing Value of at least one Reference Asset will decline during the term of the Notes such that the Closing Value of at least one\\xa0Reference Asset will fall below its Coupon Barrier Value on one or more Observation Dates and/or the Final Value of at least one Reference Asset will fall below its Barrier Value. ● You are unwilling or unable to accept the individual market risk of each Reference Asset and/or do not understand that any decline in the value of one Reference Asset will not be offset or mitigated by a lesser decline or any potential increase in the value of any other Reference Asset. ● You do not understand and/or are unwilling\\xa0or unable to accept the risks associated with an investment linked to the performance of the Reference Assets. ● You are unwilling or unable to accept the risk that the negative performance of only one Reference Asset may cause you to not receive Contingent\\xa0Coupons and/or suffer a loss of principal at maturity, regardless of the performance of any other Reference Asset. ● You are unwilling or unable to accept the risk that the Notes may be redeemed prior to scheduled maturity. ● You seek an investment that\\xa0entitles you to dividends or distributions on, or voting rights related to any Reference Asset or any securities to which any Reference Asset provides exposure. PS—6 ● You cannot tolerate fluctuations in the price of the Notes prior to scheduled maturity that may\\xa0be similar to or exceed the downside fluctuations in the values of the Reference Assets. ● You seek an investment for which there will be an active secondary market, and/or you are unwilling or unable to hold the Notes to maturity if the Notes are not redeemed. ● You prefer the lower risk, and therefore accept the potentially lower returns, of fixed income investments with comparable maturities and credit ratings. ● You are unwilling or unable to assume our credit risk for all payments on the Notes. ● You are unwilling or unable to consent to the exercise of any U.K. Bail-in Power by any relevant U.K. resolution authority. You must rely on your own evaluation of the merits of an investment in the Notes.\\xa0You should reach a decision whether to invest in the Notes after carefully considering, with your advisors, the suitability of the Notes in light of your investment objectives and the specific information set out in this pricing supplement and the documents referenced under “Additional Documents Related to the Offering of the Notes” in this pricing supplement. Neither the Issuer nor Barclays Capital Inc. makes any recommendation as to the suitability of the Notes for investment. PS—7 ADDITIONAL TERMS OF THE NOTES The Observation Dates (including the Final Valuation Date), the Contingent Coupon Payment Dates, any Call Settlement Date and the Maturity Date are subject to postponement in certain circumstances, as described under “Reference Assets—Equity Securities—Market Disruption Events for Securities with an Equity Security as a Reference Asset,” “Reference Assets—Least or Best Performing Reference Asset—Scheduled Trading Days and Market Disruption Events for Securities Linked to the Reference Asset with the Lowest or Highest Return in a Group of Two or More Equity Securities, Exchange-Traded Funds and/or Indices of Equity Securities” and “Terms of the Notes—Payment Dates” in the accompanying prospectus supplement. In addition, the Reference Assets and the Notes are subject to adjustment by the Calculation Agent under\\xa0certain circumstances, as described under “Reference Assets—Equity Securities—Share Adjustments Relating to Securities with an Equity Security as a Reference Asset” in the accompanying prospectus supplement. PS—8 HYPOTHETICAL EXAMPLES OF AMOUNTS PAYABLE ON A\\xa0SINGLE CONTINGENT COUPON PAYMENT DATE The following examples demonstrate the circumstances under which you may receive a Contingent Coupon on a hypothetical Contingent Coupon Payment Date. The numbers appearing in these tables are purely hypothetical and are provided for illustrative purposes only. These examples do not take into account any tax consequences from investing in the Notes and make the following key assumptions: ■ Hypothetical\\xa0Initial Value of each Reference Asset: $100.00* ■ Hypothetical\\xa0Coupon Barrier Value for each Reference Asset: $60.00 (60.00% of the hypothetical Initial Value set forth above)* ■ Hypothetical\\xa0Call Value for each Reference Asset: $100.00 (100.00% of the hypothetical Initial Value set forth above)* * The hypothetical Initial Value of $100.00, the hypothetical Coupon Barrier Value of $60.00 and the hypothetical Call Value of $100.00 for each Reference Asset have been chosen for illustrative purposes only and do not represent a likely Initial Value, Coupon Barrier Value or Call Value\\xa0for any Reference Asset. The actual Initial Value for each Reference Asset will be equal to its Closing Value on the Initial Valuation Date and the actual Coupon Barrier Value and Call Value for each Reference Asset will be equal to 60.00% and 100.00%, respectively, of its Initial Value. Example 1: The Closing Value of each Reference Asset is greater than its Coupon Barrier Value on the relevant Observation Date. Reference Asset Closing Value on Relevant Observation Date AAPL $99.00 AMZN $65.00 TSLA $70.00 Because the Closing Value of each Reference Asset is greater than its respective Coupon Barrier Value, you will receive a Contingent Coupon of $16.667 (1.6667% of the principal amount per Note) on the related Contingent Coupon Payment Date. Example 2: The Closing Value of one Reference Asset is greater than its Coupon Barrier Value on the relevant Observation Date and the Closing Value of at least one Reference Asset is less than its Coupon Barrier Value on the relevant Observation Date. Reference Asset Closing Value on Relevant Observation Date AAPL $70.00 AMZN $59.00 TSLA $40.00 Because the Closing Value of at least one Reference Asset is less than its Coupon Barrier Value, you will not receive a Contingent Coupon on the related\\xa0Contingent Coupon Payment Date. Example 3: The Closing Value of each Reference Asset is less than its Coupon Barrier Value on the relevant Observation Date. Reference Asset Closing Value on Relevant Observation Date AAPL $58.00 AMZN $40.00 TSLA $35.00 Because the Closing Value of at least one Reference Asset is less than its Coupon Barrier Value, you will not receive a Contingent Coupon on the related Contingent Coupon Payment Date. Examples 2 and 3 demonstrate that you may not receive a\\xa0Contingent Coupon on a Contingent Coupon Payment Date. If the Closing Value of any Reference Asset is below its Coupon Barrier Value on each Observation Date, you will not receive any Contingent Coupons during the term of the Notes. In each of the examples above, because the Closing Value of at least one Reference Asset is below its Call Value on the relevant Call Valuation Date, the Notes will not be redeemed on such date. The Notes will be redeemed only if the Closing Value of each Reference Asset on any\\xa0Call Valuation Date is greater than or equal to its respective Call Value. PS—9 HYPOTHETICAL EXAMPLES OF AMOUNTS PAYABLE UPON AUTOMATIC CALL The following examples demonstrate the hypothetical total return upon an Automatic Call under various circumstances. The “total return” as used in these examples is the number, expressed as a percentage, that results from comparing the aggregate payments per $1,000 principal amount Note to $1,000. The hypothetical total returns set forth below are for illustrative purposes\\xa0only and may not be the actual total returns applicable to a purchaser of the Notes. The numbers appearing in the following tables and examples have been rounded for ease of analysis. The hypothetical examples below do not take into account any tax consequences from investing in the Notes and make the following key assumption: ■ For each Observation Date that is not also a Call Valuation Date, the Closing Value of at least one Reference Asset is less than its Coupon Barrier Value. Accordingly, you will NOT\\xa0receive Contingent Coupons on those Observation Dates, unless indicated otherwise below. Example 1: The Notes are redeemed on the first Call Valuation Date. Call Valuation Date Is the Closing Value of any Reference Asset Less Than\\xa0its Coupon Barrier Value? Is the Closing Value of any Reference Asset Less Than\\xa0its Call Value? Payment on Contingent Coupon Payment Date\\xa0(per $1,000 principal amount Note) 1 No No $1,016.667 Because the Closing Value of each Reference Asset on the first Call Valuation Date is\\xa0greater than or equal to its Call Value, the Notes are redeemed and you will receive the Redemption Price on the related Call Settlement Date. The Notes will cease to be outstanding after the Call Settlement Date, and you will not receive any further payments on the Notes. The total return on investment of the Notes is 1.6667%. Example 2: The Notes are redeemed on the\\xa0third Call Valuation Date. Call Valuation Date Is the Closing Value of any Reference Asset Less Than\\xa0its Coupon Barrier Value? Is the Closing Value of any Reference Asset Less Than\\xa0its Call Value? Payment on Contingent Coupon Payment Date\\xa0(per $1,000 principal amount Note) 1 No Yes $16.667 2 Yes Yes $0.00 3 No No $1,016.667 Because the\\xa0Closing Value of each Reference Asset on the third Call Valuation Date is greater than or equal to its Call Value, the Notes are redeemed and you will receive the Redemption Price on the related Call Settlement Date. The Notes will cease to be outstanding\\xa0after the Call Settlement Date, and you will not receive any further payments on the Notes. The total return on investment of the Notes is 3.3334%. Example 3: The Notes are redeemed on the final Call Valuation Date. Call Valuation Date Is the Closing Value of any Reference Asset Less Than\\xa0its Coupon Barrier Value? Is the Closing Value of any Reference Asset Less Than\\xa0its Call Value? Payment on Contingent Coupon Payment Date\\xa0(per $1,000 principal amount Note) 1 Yes Yes $0.00 2 - 29 With respect to each\\xa0Call Valuation Date, Yes With respect to each Call Valuation Date, Yes $0.00 30 No No $1,016.667 Because the Closing Value of each Reference Asset on the final Call Valuation Date is greater than or equal to its Call Value, the Notes are\\xa0redeemed and you will receive the Redemption Price on the related Call Settlement Date. Example 3 demonstrates that the Closing Value of at least one Reference Asset is less than its Coupon Barrier Value on each Observation Date prior to the final Call Valuation Date. Accordingly, no Contingent Coupons are payable on the Notes until the final Call Valuation Date. The Notes will cease to be outstanding after the Call Settlement Date, and you will not receive any further payments on the Notes. The total return on investment of the Notes is 1.6667%. Each of the examples above demonstrate that the return on the Notes upon an Automatic Call will be limited to the Contingent Coupons, if any, that may be payable on the Notes up to and including the applicable Call\\xa0Settlement Date. PS—10 Each of the examples above demonstrate that a Contingent Coupon will be payable on a Contingent Coupon Payment Date only if the Closing Value of each Reference Asset is greater than or equal to its respective Coupon Barrier Value on an Observation Date. If the Closing Value of any Reference Asset on an Observation Date is less than its Coupon Barrier Value, you will not receive a Contingent Coupon on the related Contingent Coupon Payment Date. If the Closing Value of any Reference Asset is\\xa0less than its Coupon Barrier Value on each Observation Date, you will not receive any Contingent Coupons during the term of the Notes. PS—11 HYPOTHETICAL EXAMPLES OF AMOUNTS PAYABLE AT MATURITY The following table illustrates the hypothetical payment at\\xa0maturity under various circumstances. The examples set forth below are purely hypothetical and are provided for illustrative purposes only. The numbers appearing in the following table and examples have been rounded for ease of analysis. The hypothetical examples below do not take into account any tax consequences from investing in the Notes and make the following key assumptions: ■ Hypothetical\\xa0Initial Value of each Reference Asset: $100.00* ■ Hypothetical Coupon Barrier Value for each Reference Asset: $60.00\\xa0(60.00% of the hypothetical Initial Value set forth above)* ■ Hypothetical\\xa0Barrier Value for each Reference Asset: $60.00 (60.00% of the hypothetical Initial Value set forth above)* ■ You hold the Notes to maturity, and the Notes are NOT\\xa0redeemed prior to scheduled maturity. * The hypothetical Initial Value of $100.00, the hypothetical Coupon Barrier Value of $60.00 and the hypothetical Barrier Value of $60.00 for each Reference Asset have been chosen for illustrative purposes only and do not represent a likely\\xa0Initial Value, Coupon Barrier Value or Barrier Value for any Reference Asset. The actual Initial Value for each Reference Asset will be equal to its Closing Value on the Initial Valuation Date, and the actual Coupon Barrier Value and Barrier Value for each Reference Asset will each be equal to 60.00% of its Initial Value.

The following examples illustrate how the payments at maturity set forth in the table above are calculated: Example 1: The Final Value of Reference Asset A is $135.00, the Final Value of Reference Asset B is $130.00 and the Final Value of Reference Asset C is $140.00. Because Reference Asset B has the lowest Reference Asset Return, Reference Asset B is the Least Performing Reference Asset. Because the Final Value of the Least Performing Reference Asset is greater than or equal to its Barrier Value, you will receive a payment at maturity of $1,000 per $1,000 principal amount Note that you hold (plus\\xa0the Contingent Coupon that will otherwise be payable on the Maturity Date). PS—12 Example 2: The Final Value of Reference Asset A is $140.00, the Final Value of Reference Asset B is $90.00 and the Final Value of Reference Asset C is $105.00. Because Reference Asset B has the lowest Reference Asset Return, Reference Asset B is the Least Performing Reference Asset. Because the Final Value of the Least Performing Reference Asset is greater than or equal to its Barrier Value, you will receive a payment at maturity of $1,000 per $1,000 principal amount Note that you hold (plus the Contingent\\xa0Coupon that will otherwise be payable on the Maturity Date). Example 3: The Final Value of Reference Asset A is $135.00, the Final Value of Reference Asset B is $50.00 and the Final Value of Reference Asset C is $110.00. Because Reference Asset B has\\xa0the lowest Reference Asset Return, Reference Asset B is the Least Performing Reference Asset. Because the Final Value of the Least Performing Reference Asset is less than its Barrier Value, you will receive a payment at maturity of $500.00 per $1,000 principal amount Note that you hold, calculated as follows: $1,000 + [$1,000 × Reference Asset Return of the Least Performing Reference Asset] $1,000 + [$1,000 × -50.00%] = $500.00 In addition, because the Final Value of at least one Reference Asset is less than its Coupon Barrier Value, you will not receive a Contingent Coupon on the Maturity Date. Example 3 demonstrates that if the Notes are not redeemed prior to scheduled maturity, and if the Final Value of the Least Performing Reference Asset is less than its Barrier Value, your investment in the Notes will be fully exposed to the decline of the Least Performing Reference Asset from its Initial Value. You will not benefit in any way from the Reference Asset Return of any other Reference Asset being higher than the Reference Asset Return of the Least Performing Reference Asset. If the Notes are not redeemed prior to scheduled maturity, you may lose up to\\xa0100.00% of the principal amount of your Notes. Any payment on the Notes, including the repayment of principal, is subject to the credit risk of Barclays Bank PLC. PS—13 SELECTED RISK CONSIDERATIONS An investment in the Notes involves significant risks. Investing in the Notes is not equivalent to investing directly in the Reference Assets or their components, if any. Some of the risks that apply to an investment in the Notes are summarized below, but we urge you to read the more detailed explanation of risks relating to the Notes generally in the “Risk Factors” section of the prospectus supplement. You should not purchase the Notes unless you understand and can bear the risks of investing in the Notes. Risks Relating to the Notes Generally ● Your Investment in the Notes May Result in a Significant Loss — The Notes differ from ordinary debt securities in that the Issuer will not necessarily repay the full principal amount of the Notes at maturity. If the Notes are not redeemed prior to scheduled maturity, and if the Final Value of the Least Performing Reference Asset is less than its Barrier Value, your Notes will be fully exposed to the decline of the Least Performing Reference Asset from its Initial Value. You may lose up to\\xa0100.00% of the principal amount of your Notes. ● Potential Return is Limited to the Contingent Coupons, If Any, and You Will Not Participate in Any Appreciation of Any Reference Asset\\xa0— The potential positive return on the Notes is limited to the Contingent Coupons, if any, that may be payable during the term of the Notes. You will not participate in any appreciation in the value of any Reference Asset, which may be significant, even though you will be exposed to the depreciation in the value of the Least Performing Reference Asset if the Notes are not redeemed and the Final Value of the Least Performing Reference Asset is less than its Barrier Value. ● You May Not Receive Any Contingent Coupon Payments on the Notes — The Issuer will not necessarily make periodic coupon payments on the Notes. You will receive a Contingent Coupon on a Contingent Coupon Payment Date only if\\xa0the Closing Value of each Reference Asset on the related Observation Date is greater than or equal to its respective Coupon Barrier Value. If the Closing Value of any Reference Asset on an Observation Date is less than its Coupon Barrier Value, you will not receive a Contingent Coupon on the related Contingent Coupon Payment Date. If the Closing Value of at least one Reference Asset is less than its respective Coupon Barrier Value on each Observation Date, you will not receive any Contingent Coupons during the term of the Notes. ● Because the Notes Are Linked to the Least Performing Reference Asset, You Are Exposed to Greater Risks of No Contingent Coupons and Sustaining a Significant Loss of Principal at Maturity Than If the Notes Were Linked to a Single Reference Asset — The risk that you will not receive any Contingent Coupons and lose a significant portion or all of your principal amount in the Notes at maturity is greater if you invest in the Notes as opposed to substantially similar securities that are linked to the performance of a single\\xa0Reference Asset. With multiple Reference Assets, it is more likely that the Closing Value of at least one Reference Asset will be less than its Coupon Barrier Value on the specified Observation Dates or less than its Barrier Value on the Final Valuation Date, and therefore, it is more likely that you will not receive any Contingent Coupons and that you will suffer a significant loss of principal at maturity. Further, the performance of the Reference Assets may not be correlated or may be negatively correlated. The lower the correlation between multiple Reference Assets, the greater the potential for one of those Reference Assets to close below its Coupon Barrier Value or Barrier Value on an Observation Date or the Final Valuation Date, respectively. It is impossible to predict what the correlation among the Reference Assets will be over the term of the Notes. The Reference Assets represent different equity markets. These different equity markets may not perform similarly over the term of the Notes. Although the correlation of the Reference Assets’ performance may change over the term of the Notes, the Contingent Coupon rate is determined, in part, based on the correlation of the Reference Assets’ performance calculated using our internal models at the time when the terms of the Notes are finalized. A higher Contingent Coupon is generally associated with lower correlation of the Reference Assets, which reflects a greater potential for missed Contingent Coupons and for a loss of principal at maturity. ● You Are Exposed to the Market Risk of Each Reference Asset — Your return on the Notes is not linked to a basket consisting of the Reference Assets. Rather, it will be contingent upon the independent performance of each Reference Asset. Unlike an instrument with a return linked to a basket of underlying assets in which risk is mitigated and diversified among all the components of the basket, you will be exposed to the risks related to each Reference Asset. Poor performance by any Reference Asset over the term of the\\xa0Notes may negatively affect your return and will not be offset or mitigated by any increases or lesser declines in the value of any other Reference Asset. To receive a Contingent Coupon, the Closing Value of each Reference Asset must be greater than or equal to its Coupon Barrier Value on the applicable Observation Date. In addition, if the Notes have not been redeemed prior to scheduled maturity, and if the Final Value of any Reference Asset is less than its Barrier Value, you will be exposed to the full decline in the Least Performing Reference Asset from its Initial Value. Accordingly, your investment is subject to the market risk of each Reference Asset. ● The Notes Are Subject to Volatility Risk — Volatility is a measure of the degree of variation in the price of an asset (or level of an index) over a period of time. The amount of any coupon payments that may be payable under the Notes is based on a number of factors, including the expected volatility of the Reference Assets. The amount of such coupon payments will be paid at a per annum rate that is higher than the fixed rate that we would pay on a conventional debt security of the same tenor and is higher than it otherwise would have been had the expected volatility of the Reference Assets been lower. As volatility of a Reference Asset increases, there will typically be a greater likelihood that (a) the Closing Value of that Reference Asset on one or more Observation Dates will be less than its Coupon Barrier Value and (b) the Final Value of that Reference\\xa0Asset will be less than its Barrier Value. PS—14 Accordingly, you should understand that a higher coupon payment amount reflects, among other things, an indication of a greater likelihood that you will (a) not receive coupon payments with respect to one or more\\xa0Observation Dates and/or (b) incur a loss of principal at maturity than would have been the case had the amount of such coupon payments been lower. In addition, actual volatility over the term of the Notes may be significantly higher than the expected volatility at the time the terms of the Notes were determined. If actual volatility is higher than expected, you will face an even greater risk that you will not receive coupon payments and/or that you will lose some or all of your principal at maturity for the reasons described above. ● Early Redemption and Reinvestment Risk — While the original term of the Notes is as indicated on the cover of this pricing supplement, the Notes may be redeemed prior to maturity, as described above, and the holding period over\\xa0which you may receive any coupon payments that may be payable under the Notes could be as short as approximately six months. The Redemption Price that you would receive on a Call Settlement Date, together with any coupon payments that you may have received prior to the Call Settlement Date, may be less than the aggregate amount of payments that you would have received had the Notes not been redeemed. There is no guarantee that you would be able to reinvest the proceeds from an investment in the Notes in a comparable investment with a similar level of risk in the event the Notes are redeemed prior to the Maturity Date. No additional payments will be due after the relevant Call Settlement Date. The fact that the Notes may be redeemed prior to maturity may also\\xa0adversely impact your ability to sell your Notes and the price at which they may be sold. ● Any Payment on the Notes Will Be Determined Based on the Closing Values of the Reference Assets on the Dates Specified — Any payment on the Notes will be determined based on the Closing Values of the Reference Assets on the dates specified. You will not benefit from any more favorable values of the Reference Assets determined at any other time. ● Contingent Repayment of Any Principal Amount Applies Only at Maturity or upon Any Redemption — You should be willing to hold your Notes to maturity or any redemption. Although the Notes provide for the contingent repayment of the principal amount of your Notes at maturity, provided that the Final Value of the Least Performing Reference Asset is greater than or equal to its Barrier Value, or upon any redemption, if you sell your Notes prior to such time in the secondary market, if any, you may have to sell your Notes at a price that is less than the principal amount even if at that\\xa0time the value of each Reference Asset has increased from its Initial Value. See “Many Economic and Market Factors Will Impact the Value of the Notes” below. ● Owning the Notes is Not the Same as Owning Any Reference Asset or Any Securities to which Any Reference Asset Provides Exposure\\xa0— The return on the Notes may not reflect the return you would realize if you actually owned any Reference Asset or any securities to which any Reference Asset provides exposure. As a holder of the Notes, you will not have voting rights or rights to receive dividends or other distributions or any other rights that holders of any Reference Asset or any securities to which any Reference Asset provides exposure may have. ● Tax Treatment — Significant aspects of the tax treatment of\\xa0the Notes are uncertain. You should consult your tax advisor about your tax situation. See “Tax Considerations” below. Risks Relating to the Issuer ● Credit of Issuer — The Notes are unsecured and unsubordinated debt obligations of the Issuer, Barclays Bank PLC, and are not, either directly or indirectly, an obligation of any third party. Any payment to be made on the Notes, including any repayment of principal, is subject to the ability of Barclays Bank PLC to satisfy its obligations as they come due and is not guaranteed by any third party. As a result, the actual and perceived creditworthiness of Barclays Bank PLC may affect the market value of the Notes, and in the event Barclays Bank PLC were to default on its obligations, you may not receive any amounts\\xa0owed to you under the terms of the Notes. ● You May Lose Some or All of Your Investment If Any U.K. Bail-in Power Is Exercised by the Relevant U.K. Resolution Authority — Notwithstanding and to the exclusion of any other term of the Notes or any other agreements, arrangements or understandings between Barclays Bank PLC and any holder or beneficial owner of the Notes (or the Trustee on behalf of the holders of the Notes), by acquiring the Notes, each holder and beneficial owner of the Notes acknowledges, accepts, agrees to be bound by, and consents to the exercise of, any U.K. Bail-in Power by the relevant U.K. resolution authority as set forth under “Consent to U.K. Bail-in Power” in this pricing supplement. Accordingly, any U.K. Bail-in Power may be exercised in such a manner as to result in you and other holders and beneficial owners of the Notes losing all or a part of the value of your investment in the Notes or receiving a different security from the Notes, which may be worth significantly less than the Notes and which may have significantly fewer protections than those typically afforded to debt securities. Moreover, the relevant U.K. resolution authority may exercise\\xa0the U.K. Bail-in Power without providing any advance notice to, or requiring the consent of, the holders and beneficial owners of the Notes. The exercise of any U.K. Bail-in Power by the relevant U.K. resolution authority with respect to the Notes will not be a default or an Event of Default (as each term is defined in the senior debt securities indenture) and the trustee will not be liable for any action that the trustee takes, or abstains from taking, in either case, in accordance with the exercise of the U.K. Bail-in Power by the relevant U.K. resolution authority with respect to the Notes. See “Consent to U.K. Bail-in Power” in this pricing supplement as well as “U.K. Bail-in Power,” “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to the Securities Generally—Regulatory action in the event a bank or investment firm in the Group is failing or likely to fail, including the exercise by the relevant U.K. resolution authority of a variety of statutory resolution powers, could materially adversely affect the value of any securities” and “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to the Securities Generally—Under the terms of the securities, you have agreed to be bound by the exercise of any U.K. Bail-in Power by the relevant U.K. resolution authority” in the accompanying prospectus supplement. PS—15 Risks Relating to the Reference Assets ● Historical Performance of the Reference Assets Should Not Be Taken as Any Indication of the Future Performance of the Reference Assets Over the Term of the Notes — The value of each Reference Asset has fluctuated in\\xa0the past and may, in the future, experience significant fluctuations. The historical performance of a Reference Asset is not an indication of the future performance of that Reference Asset over the term of the Notes. The historical correlation among the Reference Assets is not an indication of the future correlation among them over the term of the Notes. Therefore, the performance of the Reference Assets individually or in comparison to each other over the term of the Notes may bear no relation or resemblance to the historical performance of any Reference Asset. ● Single Equity Risk\\xa0— The values of the Reference Assets can rise or fall sharply due to factors specific to each Reference Asset and its issuer, such as stock price volatility, earnings, financial conditions, corporate, industry and regulatory developments, management changes and decisions and other events, as well as general market factors, such as general stock market volatility and levels, interest rates and economic and political conditions. We urge you to review financial and other information filed periodically with the SEC by the issuers of the Reference Assets. We have not undertaken any independent review or due diligence of the SEC filings of the issuers of the Reference Assets or of any other publicly available information regarding any such issuer. ● Anti-Dilution Protection Is Limited, and the Calculation Agent Has Discretion to Make Anti-Dilution Adjustments — The Calculation Agent may in its sole discretion make adjustments affecting the amounts payable on the Notes upon the occurrence of certain corporate events (such as stock splits or extraordinary or special dividends) that the Calculation Agent determines have a diluting or concentrative effect on the theoretical value of any Reference Asset. However, the Calculation Agent might not make such adjustments in response to all events that could affect any Reference Asset. The occurrence of any such event and any adjustment made by the Calculation Agent (or a determination by the Calculation\\xa0Agent not to make any adjustment) may adversely affect any amounts payable on the Notes. See “Reference Assets—Equity Securities—Share Adjustments Relating to Securities with an Equity Security as a Reference Asset” in the accompanying prospectus supplement. ● Reorganization Or Other Events Could Adversely Affect the Value of the Notes Or Result in the Notes Being Accelerated — Upon the occurrence of certain reorganization events or a nationalization, expropriation, liquidation, bankruptcy, insolvency or de-listing of any Reference Asset, the Calculation Agent will make adjustments to that Reference Asset that may result in payments on the Notes being based on the performance of shares, cash or other assets distributed to holders of that Reference Asset upon\\xa0the occurrence of such event or, in some cases, the Calculation Agent may accelerate the maturity date for a payment determined by the Calculation Agent. Any of these actions could adversely affect the value of any Reference Asset and, consequently, the value of the Notes. Any amount payable upon acceleration could be significantly less than the amount(s) that would be due on the Notes if they were not accelerated. See “Reference Assets—Equity Securities—Share Adjustments Relating to Securities with an Equity Security as a Reference Asset” in the accompanying prospectus supplement. Risks Relating to Conflicts of Interest ● We and Our Affiliates May Engage in Various Activities or Make Determinations That Could Materially Affect the Notes in Various Ways and Create Conflicts of Interest — We and our affiliates play a variety of roles in connection with the issuance of the Notes, as described below. In performing these roles, our and our affiliates’ economic interests are potentially adverse to your interests as\\xa0an investor in the Notes. In connection with our normal business activities and in connection with hedging our obligations under the Notes, we and our affiliates make markets in and trade various financial instruments or products for our accounts and for the account of our clients and otherwise provide investment banking and other financial services with respect to these financial instruments and products. These financial instruments and products may include securities, derivative instruments or assets that\\xa0may relate to the Reference Assets or their components, if any. In any such market making, trading and hedging activity, and other financial services, we or our affiliates may take positions or take actions that are inconsistent with, or adverse to, the investment objectives of the holders of the Notes. We and our affiliates have no obligation to take the needs of any buyer, seller or holder of the Notes into account in conducting these activities. Such market making, trading and hedging activity, investment banking and other financial services may negatively impact the value of the Notes. In addition, the role played by Barclays Capital Inc., as the agent for the Notes, could present significant conflicts of interest with the role of Barclays Bank PLC, as\\xa0issuer of the Notes. For example, Barclays Capital Inc. or its representatives may derive compensation or financial benefit from the distribution of the Notes and such compensation or financial benefit may serve as incentive to sell the Notes instead of other investments. Furthermore, we and our affiliates establish the offering price of the Notes for initial sale to the public, and the offering price is not based upon any independent verification or valuation. In addition to the activities described above,\\xa0we will also act as the Calculation Agent for the Notes. As Calculation Agent, we will determine any values of the Reference Assets and make any other determinations necessary to calculate any payments on the Notes. In making these determinations, the Calculation Agent may be required to make discretionary judgements relating to the Reference Assets, including determining whether a market disruption event has occurred or whether certain adjustments to the Reference Assets or other terms of the Notes are necessary, as further described in the accompanying prospectus supplement. In making these discretionary judgments, our economic interests are potentially adverse to your interests as an investor in the Notes, and any of these determinations may adversely affect any payments on the Notes. PS—16 Risks Relating to the Estimated Value of the Notes and the Secondary Market ● The Estimated Value of Your Notes is Expected to be Lower Than the Initial Issue Price of Your Notes — The estimated value of your Notes on the Initial Valuation Date is expected to be lower, and may be significantly lower, than the initial issue price of your Notes. The difference between the initial issue price of your Notes and the estimated value of the Notes is a result of certain factors, such as any sales commissions to be paid to Barclays Capital Inc. or another affiliate of ours, any selling concessions, discounts, commissions or fees (including any structuring or other distribution related fees) to be allowed or paid to non-affiliated intermediaries, the estimated profit that we or any of our affiliates expect to earn in connection with structuring the Notes, the estimated cost which we may incur in hedging our obligations under the Notes, and estimated development and other costs which we may\\xa0incur in connection with the Notes. ● The Estimated Value of Your Notes Might be Lower if Such Estimated Value Were Based on the Levels at Which Our Debt Securities Trade in the Secondary Market\\xa0— The estimated value of your Notes on the Initial Valuation Date is based on a number of variables, including our internal funding rates. Our internal funding rates may vary from the levels at which our benchmark debt securities trade in the secondary market. As a result of this difference, the estimated value referenced above might be lower if such estimated value were based on the levels at which our benchmark debt securities trade in the secondary market. ● The Estimated Value of the Notes is Based on Our Internal Pricing Models, Which May Prove to be Inaccurate and May be Different from the Pricing Models of Other Financial Institutions — The estimated value of your Notes on the Initial Valuation Date is based on our internal pricing models, which take into account a number of variables and are based on a number of\\xa0subjective assumptions, which may or may not materialize. These variables and assumptions are not evaluated or verified on an independent basis. Further, our pricing models may be different from other financial institutions’ pricing models and the methodologies used by us to estimate the value of the Notes may not be consistent with those of other financial institutions which may be purchasers or sellers of Notes in the secondary market. As a result, the secondary market price of your Notes may be materially different from the estimated value of the Notes determined by reference to our internal pricing models. ● The Estimated Value of Your Notes Is Not a Prediction of the Prices at Which You May Sell Your Notes in the Secondary Market, if any, and Such Secondary Market Prices, If Any, Will Likely be Lower Than the Initial Issue Price of Your Notes and May be Lower Than the Estimated Value of Your Notes\\xa0— The estimated value of the Notes will not be a prediction of the prices at which Barclays Capital Inc., other affiliates of ours or third parties may be willing to purchase the Notes from you in secondary market transactions (if they are willing to purchase, which they are not obligated to do). The price at which you may be able to sell your Notes in the secondary market at any time will be influenced by many factors that cannot be predicted, such as market conditions, and any bid and ask spread for similar sized trades, and may be substantially less than our estimated value of the Notes. Further, as secondary market prices of your Notes take into account the levels at which our debt securities trade in the secondary market, and do not take into account our various costs related to the Notes such as fees, commissions, discounts, and the costs of hedging our obligations under the Notes, secondary market prices of your Notes will likely be lower than the initial issue price of your Notes. As a result, the price at which Barclays Capital Inc., other affiliates of ours or third parties may be willing to purchase the Notes from you in secondary market transactions, if any, will likely be lower than the price you paid for your Notes, and any sale prior to the Maturity Date could result in a substantial loss to you. ● The Temporary Price at Which We May Initially Buy The Notes in the Secondary Market And the Value We May Initially Use for Customer Account Statements, If We Provide Any Customer Account Statements At All, May Not Be Indicative of Future Prices of Your Notes\\xa0— Assuming that all relevant factors remain constant after the Initial Valuation Date, the price at which Barclays Capital Inc. may initially buy or sell the Notes in the secondary market (if Barclays Capital Inc. makes a market in the Notes, which it is not obligated to do) and the value that we may initially use for customer account statements, if we provide any customer account statements at all, may exceed our estimated value of the Notes on the Initial Valuation Date, as well as the secondary market value of the Notes, for a temporary period after the initial Issue Date of the Notes. The price at which Barclays Capital Inc. may initially buy or sell the Notes in the secondary market and the value that we may initially use for customer account statements may not be indicative of future prices of your Notes. ● Lack of Liquidity\\xa0— The Notes will not be listed on any securities exchange. Barclays Capital Inc. and other affiliates of Barclays Bank PLC intend to make a secondary market for the Notes but are not required to do so, and may discontinue any such secondary market making at any time, without notice. Barclays Capital Inc. may at any time hold unsold inventory, which may inhibit the development of a secondary market for the Notes. Even if there is a secondary market, it may not provide enough liquidity to allow you to trade or sell the Notes easily. Because other dealers are not likely to make a secondary market for the Notes, the price at which you may be able to trade your Notes is likely to depend on the price, if any, at which Barclays Capital Inc. and other affiliates of Barclays Bank PLC are willing to buy the Notes. The Notes are not designed to be short-term trading instruments. Accordingly, you should be willing and able to hold your Notes to maturity. ● Many Economic and Market Factors Will Impact the Value of the Notes\\xa0— The value of the Notes will be affected by a number of economic and market factors that interact in complex and unpredictable ways and that may either offset or magnify each other, including: o the market price of, dividend rate on and\\xa0expected volatility of the Reference Assets or the components of the Reference Assets, if any; o correlation (or lack of correlation) of the Reference Assets; PS—17 o the time to maturity of the Notes; o interest and yield rates in the market generally; o a\\xa0variety of economic, financial, political, regulatory or judicial events; o supply and demand for the Notes; and o our creditworthiness, including actual or anticipated downgrades in our credit ratings. PS—18 INFORMATION REGARDING THE REFERENCE ASSETS We urge\\xa0you to read the following section in the accompanying prospectus supplement: “Reference Assets—Equity Securities—Reference Asset Issuer and Reference Asset Information.” Companies with securities registered under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, which is commonly referred to as the “Exchange Act,” and the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended, which is commonly referred to as the “’40 Act,” are required to periodically file certain financial and other information specified by the SEC. Information provided to or filed with the SEC electronically can be accessed through a website maintained by the SEC. The address of the SEC’s website is http://www.sec.gov.

Historical Performance of the Common Stock of Tesla, Inc. PAST PERFORMANCE IS NOT INDICATIVE OF FUTURE RESULTS PS—21 TAX CONSIDERATIONS You should review carefully the sections in the accompanying prospectus supplement entitled “Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences—Tax Consequences to U.S. Holders—Notes Treated as Prepaid Forward or Derivative Contracts with Associated Contingent Coupons” and, if you are a non-U.S. holder, “—Tax Consequences to Non-U.S. Holders.” The following discussion supersedes the discussion in the accompanying prospectus supplement to the extent it is inconsistent therewith. In determining our reporting responsibilities, if any, we intend to treat (i) the Notes for U.S. federal income tax purposes as prepaid forward contracts with associated contingent coupons and (ii) any Contingent Coupon payments as ordinary income, as described in the section entitled “Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences—Tax Consequences to U.S. Holders—Notes Treated as Prepaid Forward or Derivative Contracts with Associated Contingent Coupons” in the accompanying prospectus supplement. Our special tax counsel, Davis Polk & Wardwell LLP, has advised that it believes this treatment to be reasonable, but that there are other reasonable treatments that the Internal Revenue Service (the “IRS”) or a court may adopt. Sale, exchange or redemption of a Note. Assuming the treatment described above is respected, upon a sale or exchange of the Notes (including redemption upon an automatic call or at maturity), you should recognize capital gain or loss equal to the difference between the amount realized on the sale or exchange and your tax basis in the Notes, which should equal the amount you paid to acquire the Notes (assuming Contingent Coupon payments are properly treated as ordinary income, consistent with the position\\xa0referred to above). This gain or loss should be short-term capital gain or loss unless you hold the Notes for more than one year, in which case the gain or loss should be long-term capital gain or loss, whether or not you are an initial purchaser of the Notes at the issue price. The deductibility of capital losses is subject to limitations. If you sell your Notes between the time your right to a Contingent Coupon payment is fixed and the time it is paid, it is likely that you will be treated as receiving ordinary income equal to the Contingent Coupon payment. Although uncertain, it is possible that proceeds received from the sale or exchange of your Notes prior to an Observation Date but that can be attributed to an expected Contingent Coupon payment could be treated as ordinary income. You should consult your tax advisor regarding this issue. As noted above, there are other reasonable treatments that the IRS or a court may adopt, in which case the timing and character of any income or loss on the Notes could be materially affected. In addition, in 2007 the U.S. Treasury Department and the IRS released a notice requesting comments on the U.S. federal income tax treatment of “prepaid forward contracts” and similar instruments. The notice focuses in particular on whether to require investors in these instruments to accrue income over the term of their investment. It also asks for comments on a number of related topics, including the character of income or loss with respect to these instruments and the relevance of factors such as the nature of the underlying property to which the instruments are linked. While the notice requests comments on appropriate transition rules and effective dates, any Treasury regulations or other guidance promulgated after consideration\\xa0of these issues could materially affect the tax consequences of an investment in the Notes, possibly with retroactive effect. You should consult your tax advisor regarding the U.S. federal income tax consequences of an investment in the Notes, including possible alternative treatments and the issues presented by this notice. Non-U.S. holders.\\xa0Insofar as we have responsibility as a withholding agent, we do not currently intend to treat Contingent Coupon payments to non-U.S. holders (as defined in the accompanying prospectus supplement) as subject to U.S. withholding tax. However, non-U.S. holders should in any event expect to be required to provide appropriate Forms W-8 or other documentation in order to establish an exemption from backup withholding, as described under the heading “—Information Reporting and Backup Withholding” in the accompanying prospectus supplement. If any withholding is required, we will not be required to pay any additional amounts with respect to amounts withheld. Treasury regulations under Section 871(m) generally impose a withholding tax on certain “dividend equivalents” under certain “equity linked instruments.” A recent IRS notice excludes from the scope of Section 871(m) instruments issued prior to January 1, 2025 that do not have\\xa0a “delta of one” with respect to underlying securities that could pay U.S.-source dividends for U.S. federal income tax purposes (each an “Underlying Security”). Based on our determination that the Notes do not have a “delta of one” within the meaning of the regulations, we expect that these regulations will not apply to the Notes with regard to non-U.S. holders. Our determination is not binding on the IRS, and the IRS may disagree with this determination. Section 871(m) is complex and its application may depend on your particular circumstances, including whether you enter into other transactions with respect to an Underlying Security. If necessary, further information regarding the potential application of Section 871(m) will be provided in the pricing supplement for the Notes. You should consult your tax advisor regarding the potential application of Section 871(m) to the Notes. PS—22 SUPPLEMENTAL PLAN OF DISTRIBUTION We will agree to sell to Barclays Capital Inc. (the “Agent”), and the Agent will agree to purchase from us, the principal amount of the Notes, and at the price, specified on the cover of this pricing supplement. The Agent will commit to take and pay for all of the Notes, if any are taken. PS—23',\n",

See “Risk Factors” beginning on page S-9 of the prospectus supplement and “Selected Risk Considerations” beginning on page PS-12 of this pricing supplement. The Notes will not be listed on any U.S. securities exchange or quotation system. Neither the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) nor any state securities commission has approved or disapproved of these Notes or determined that this pricing supplement is truthful or complete. Any representation to the contrary is a criminal offense. The Notes constitute our unsecured and unsubordinated obligations. The Notes are not deposit liabilities of Barclays Bank PLC and are not covered by the U.K. Financial Services Compensation Scheme or insured by the U.S. Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any other governmental agency or deposit insurance agency of the United States, the United Kingdom or any other jurisdiction.

PS—2 ADDITIONAL DOCUMENTS RELATED TO THE OFFERING OF THE NOTES You should read this pricing supplement together with the prospectus dated May 23, 2022 as supplemented by the documents listed below, relating to our Global Medium-Term Notes, Series A, of which these Notes are a part. This pricing supplement, together with the documents listed below, contains the terms of the Notes and supersedes all prior or contemporaneous oral statements as well as any other written materials including preliminary or indicative pricing terms, correspondence, trade ideas, structures for implementation, sample structures, brochures or other educational materials of ours. You should carefully consider, among other things, the matters set forth under “Risk Factors” in the prospectus supplement and “Selected Risk Considerations” in this pricing supplement, as the Notes involve risks not associated with conventional debt securities. We urge you to consult your investment, legal, tax, accounting and other advisors before you invest in the Notes. You may access these documents on the SEC website at www.sec.gov as follows (or if such address has changed, by reviewing our filings for the relevant date on the SEC website): ● Prospectus dated May 23, 2022: http://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/312070/000119312522157585/d337542df3asr.htm ● Prospectus Supplement dated June 27, 2022: http://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0000312070/000095010322011301/dp169388_424b2-prosupp.htm ● Underlying Supplement dated June 27, 2022: http://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0000312070/000095010322011304/dp169384_424b2-underl.htm Our SEC file number is 1—10257.

PS—3 CONSENT TO U.K. BAIL-IN POWER Notwithstanding and to the exclusion of any other term of the Notes or any other agreements, arrangements or understandings between us and any holder or beneficial owner of the Notes (or the Trustee on behalf of the holders of the Notes), by acquiring the Notes, each holder and beneficial owner of the Notes acknowledges, accepts, agrees to be bound by, and consents to the exercise of, any U.K. Bail-in Power by the relevant U.K. resolution authority. Under the U.K. Banking Act 2009, as amended, the relevant U.K. resolution authority may exercise a U.K. Bail-in Power in circumstances in which the relevant U.K. resolution authority is satisfied that the resolution conditions are met. These conditions include that a U.K. bank or investment firm is failing or is likely to fail to satisfy the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 (the “FSMA”) threshold conditions for authorization to carry on certain regulated activities (within the meaning of section 55B FSMA) or, in the case of a U.K. banking group company that is a European Economic Area (“EEA”) or third country institution or investment firm, that the relevant EEA or third country relevant authority is satisfied that the resolution conditions are met in respect of that entity. The U.K. Bail-in Power includes any write-down, conversion, transfer, modification and/or suspension power, which allows for (i) the reduction or cancellation of all, or a portion, of the principal amount of, interest on, or any other amounts payable on, the Notes; (ii) the conversion of all, or a portion, of the principal amount of, interest on, or any other amounts payable on, the Notes into shares or other securities or other obligations of Barclays Bank PLC or another person (and the issue to, or conferral on, the holder or beneficial owner of the Notes such shares, securities or obligations); (iii) the cancellation of the Notes and/or (iv) the amendment or alteration of the maturity of the Notes, or amendment of the amount of interest or any other amounts due on the Notes, or the dates on which interest or any other amounts become payable, including by suspending payment for a temporary period; which U.K. Bail-in Power may be exercised by means of a variation of the terms of the Notes solely to give effect to the exercise by the relevant U.K. resolution authority of such U.K. Bail-in Power. Each holder and beneficial owner of the Notes further acknowledges and agrees that the rights of the holders or beneficial owners of the Notes are subject to, and will be varied, if necessary, solely to give effect to, the exercise of any U.K. Bail-in Power by the relevant U.K. resolution authority. For the avoidance of doubt, this consent and acknowledgment is not a waiver of any rights holders or beneficial owners of the Notes may have at law if and to the extent that any U.K. Bail-in Power is exercised by the relevant U.K. resolution authority in breach of laws applicable in England. For more information, please see “Selected Risk Considerations—Risks Relating to the Issuer—You May Lose Some or All of Your Investment If Any U.K. Bail-in Power Is Exercised by the Relevant U.K. Resolution Authority” in this pricing supplement as well as “U.K. Bail-in Power,” “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to the Securities Generally—Regulatory action in the event a bank or investment firm in the Group is failing or likely to fail, including the exercise by the relevant U.K. resolution authority of a variety of statutory resolution powers, could materially adversely affect the value of any securities” and “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to the Securities Generally—Under the terms of the securities, you have agreed to be bound by the exercise of any U.K. Bail-in Power by the relevant U.K. resolution authority” in the accompanying prospectus supplement. PS—4 ADDITIONAL INFORMATION REGARDING OUR ESTIMATED VALUE OF THE NOTES The range of the estimated values of the Notes referenced above may not correlate on a linear basis with the range of any other term of the Notes as may be set forth in this pricing supplement. We determined the size of such range based on prevailing market conditions, as well as the anticipated duration of the marketing period for the Notes. The final terms for the Notes will be determined on the date the Notes are initially priced for sale to the public, which we refer to as the Initial Valuation Date, based on prevailing market conditions on or prior to the Initial Valuation Date, and will be communicated to investors either orally or in a final pricing supplement. Our internal pricing models take into account a number of variables and are based on a number of subjective assumptions, which may or may not materialize, typically including volatility, interest rates, and our internal funding rates. Our internal funding rates (which are our internally published borrowing rates based on variables such as market benchmarks, our appetite for borrowing, and our existing obligations coming to maturity) may vary from the levels at which our benchmark debt securities trade in the secondary market. Our estimated value on the Initial Valuation Date is based on our internal funding rates. Our estimated value of the Notes may be lower if such valuation were based on the levels at which our benchmark debt securities trade in the secondary market. Our estimated value of the Notes on the Initial Valuation Date is expected to be less than the initial issue price of the Notes. The difference between the initial issue price of the Notes and our estimated value of the Notes is a result of several factors, including any sales commissions to be paid to Barclays Capital Inc. or another affiliate of ours, any selling concessions, discounts, commissions or fees (including any structuring or other distribution related fees) to be allowed or paid to non-affiliated intermediaries, the estimated profit that we or any of our affiliates expect to earn in connection with structuring the Notes, the estimated cost which we may incur in hedging our obligations under the Notes, and estimated development and other costs which we may incur in connection with the Notes. Our estimated value on the Initial Valuation Date is not a prediction of the price at which the Notes may trade in the secondary market, nor will it be the price at which Barclays Capital Inc. may buy or sell the Notes in the secondary market. Subject to normal market and funding conditions, Barclays Capital Inc. or another affiliate of ours intends to offer to purchase the Notes in the secondary market but it is not obligated to do so. Assuming that all relevant factors remain constant after the Initial Valuation Date, the price at which Barclays Capital Inc. may initially buy or sell the Notes in the secondary market, if any, and the value that we may initially use for customer account statements, if we provide any customer account statements at all, may exceed our estimated value on the Initial Valuation Date for a temporary period expected to be approximately three months after the Issue Date because, in our discretion, we may elect to effectively reimburse to investors a portion of the estimated cost of hedging our obligations under the Notes and other costs in connection with the Notes which we will no longer expect to incur over the term of the Notes. We made such discretionary election and determined this temporary reimbursement period on the basis of a number of factors, which may include the tenor of the Notes and/or any agreement we may have with the distributors of the Notes. The amount of our estimated costs which we effectively reimburse to investors in this way may not be allocated ratably throughout the reimbursement period, and we may discontinue such reimbursement at any time or revise the duration of the reimbursement period after the initial Issue Date of the Notes based on changes in market conditions and other factors that cannot be predicted. We urge you to read the “Selected Risk Considerations” beginning on page PS-12 of this pricing supplement. You may revoke your offer to purchase the Notes at any time prior to the Initial Valuation Date. We reserve the right to change the terms of, or reject any offer to purchase, the Notes prior to the Initial Valuation Date. In the event of any changes to the terms of the Notes, we will notify you and you will be asked to accept such changes in connection with your purchase. You may also choose to reject such changes in which case we may reject your offer to purchase. PS—5 SELECTED PURCHASE CONSIDERATIONS The Notes are not suitable for all investors. The Notes may be a suitable investment for you if all of the following statements are true: ● You do not seek an investment that produces fixed periodic interest or coupon payments or other non-contingent sources of current income, and you can tolerate receiving few or no Contingent Coupons over the term of the Notes in the event the Closing Value of any Reference Asset falls below its Coupon Barrier Value on one or more of the specified Observation Dates. ● You understand and accept that you will not participate in any appreciation of any Reference Asset, which may be significant, and that your return potential on the Notes is limited to the Contingent Coupons, if any, paid on the Notes. ● You can tolerate a loss of a significant portion or all of the principal amount of your Notes, and you are willing and able to make an investment that may have the full downside market risk of an investment in the Least Performing Reference Asset. ● You do not anticipate that the Closing Value of any Reference Asset will fall below its Coupon Barrier Value on any Observation Date or below its Barrier Value on the Final Valuation Date. ● You understand and accept that you will not be entitled to receive dividends or distributions that may be paid to holders of any Reference Asset or any securities to which any Reference Asset provides exposure, nor will you have any voting rights with respect to any Reference Asset or any securities to which any Reference Asset provides exposure. ● You are willing and able to accept the individual market risk of each Reference Asset and understand that any decline in the value of one Reference Asset will not be offset or mitigated by a lesser decline or any potential increase in the value of any other Reference Asset. ● You understand and accept the risks that (a) you will not receive a Contingent Coupon if the Closing Value of any Reference Asset is less than its Coupon Barrier Value on an Observation Date and (b) you will lose some or all of your principal at maturity if the Final Value of any Reference Asset is less than its Barrier Value. ● You understand and accept the risk that, if the Notes are not redeemed prior to scheduled maturity, the payment at maturity, if any, will be based solely on the Reference Asset Return of the Least Performing Reference Asset. ● You understand and are willing and able to accept the risks associated with an investment linked to the performance of the Reference Assets. ● You are willing and able to accept the risk that the Notes may be redeemed prior to scheduled maturity and that you may not be able to reinvest your money in an alternative investment with comparable risk and yield. ● You can tolerate fluctuations in the price of the Notes prior to scheduled maturity that may be similar to or exceed the downside fluctuations in the values of the Reference Assets. ● You do not seek an investment for which there will be an active secondary market, and you are willing and able to hold the Notes to maturity if the Notes are not redeemed. ● You are willing and able to assume our credit risk for all payments on the Notes. ● You are willing and able to consent to the exercise of any U.K. Bail-in Power by any relevant U.K. resolution authority. The Notes may not be a suitable investment for you if any of the following statements are true: ● You seek an investment that produces fixed periodic interest or coupon payments or other non-contingent sources of current income, and/or you cannot tolerate receiving few or no Contingent Coupons over the term of the Notes in the event the Closing Value of any Reference Asset falls below its Coupon Barrier Value on one or more of the specified Observation Dates. ● You seek an investment that participates in the full appreciation of any or all of the Reference Assets rather than an investment with a return that is limited to the Contingent Coupons, if any, paid on the Notes. ● You seek an investment that provides for the full repayment of principal at maturity, and/or you are unwilling or unable to accept the risk that you may lose some or all of the principal amount of the Notes in the event that the Final Value of the Least Performing Reference Asset falls below its Barrier Value. ● You anticipate that the Closing Value of at least one Reference Asset will decline during the term of the Notes such that the Closing Value of at least one Reference Asset will fall below its Coupon Barrier Value on one or more Observation Dates and/or the Final Value of at least one Reference Asset will fall below its Barrier Value. ● You are unwilling or unable to accept the individual market risk of each Reference Asset and/or do not understand that any decline in the value of one Reference Asset will not be offset or mitigated by a lesser decline or any potential increase in the value of any other Reference Asset. ● You do not understand and/or are unwilling or unable to accept the risks associated with an investment linked to the performance of the Reference Assets. ● You are unwilling or unable to accept the risk that the negative performance of only one Reference Asset may cause you to not receive Contingent Coupons and/or suffer a loss of principal at maturity, regardless of the performance of any other Reference Asset. ● You are unwilling or unable to accept the risk that the Notes may be redeemed prior to scheduled maturity. ● You seek an investment that entitles you to dividends or distributions on, or voting rights related to any Reference Asset or any securities to which any Reference Asset provides exposure. PS—6 ● You cannot tolerate fluctuations in the price of the Notes prior to scheduled maturity that may be similar to or exceed the downside fluctuations in the values of the Reference Assets. ● You seek an investment for which there will be an active secondary market, and/or you are unwilling or unable to hold the Notes to maturity if the Notes are not redeemed. ● You prefer the lower risk, and therefore accept the potentially lower returns, of fixed income investments with comparable maturities and credit ratings. ● You are unwilling or unable to assume our credit risk for all payments on the Notes. ● You are unwilling or unable to consent to the exercise of any U.K. Bail-in Power by any relevant U.K. resolution authority. You must rely on your own evaluation of the merits of an investment in the Notes. You should reach a decision whether to invest in the Notes after carefully considering, with your advisors, the suitability of the Notes in light of your investment objectives and the specific information set out in this pricing supplement and the documents referenced under “Additional Documents Related to the Offering of the Notes” in this pricing supplement. Neither the Issuer nor Barclays Capital Inc. makes any recommendation as to the suitability of the Notes for investment. PS—7 ADDITIONAL TERMS OF THE NOTES The Observation Dates (including the Final Valuation Date), the Contingent Coupon Payment Dates, any Call Settlement Date and the Maturity Date are subject to postponement in certain circumstances, as described under “Reference Assets—Indices—Market Disruption Events for Securities with an Index of Equity Securities as a Reference Asset,” “Reference Assets—Least or Best Performing Reference Asset—Scheduled Trading Days and Market Disruption Events for Securities Linked to the Reference Asset with the Lowest or Highest Return in a Group of Two or More Equity Securities, Exchange-Traded Funds and/or Indices of Equity Securities” and “Terms of the Notes—Payment Dates” in the accompanying prospectus supplement. In addition, the Reference Assets and the Notes are subject to adjustment by the Calculation Agent under certain circumstances, as described under “Reference Assets—Indices—Adjustments Relating to Securities with an Index as a Reference Asset” in the accompanying prospectus supplement. PS—8 HYPOTHETICAL EXAMPLES OF AMOUNTS PAYABLE ON A SINGLE CONTINGENT COUPON PAYMENT DATE The following examples demonstrate the circumstances under which you may receive a Contingent Coupon on a hypothetical Contingent Coupon Payment Date. The numbers appearing in these tables are purely hypothetical and are provided for illustrative purposes only. These examples do not take into account any tax consequences from investing in the Notes and make the following key assumptions: ■ Hypothetical Initial Value of each Reference Asset: 100.00* ■ Hypothetical Coupon Barrier Value for each Reference Asset: 70.00 (70.00% of the hypothetical Initial Value set forth above)* * The hypothetical Initial Value of 100.00 and the hypothetical Coupon Barrier Value of 70.00 for each Reference Asset have been chosen for illustrative purposes only. The actual Initial Value and Coupon Barrier Value for each Reference Asset are as set forth on the cover of this pricing supplement. Example 1: The Closing Value of each Reference Asset is greater than its Coupon Barrier Value on the relevant Observation Date. Reference Asset Closing Value on Relevant Observation Date SPX Index 100.00 RTY Index 75.00 NDX Index 80.00 Because the Closing Value of each Reference Asset is greater than its respective Coupon Barrier Value, you will receive a Contingent Coupon of $9.875 (0.9875% of the principal amount per Note) on the related Contingent Coupon Payment Date. Example 2: The Closing Value of one Reference Asset is greater than its Coupon Barrier Value on the relevant Observation Date and the Closing Value of at least one Reference Asset is less than its Coupon Barrier Value on the relevant Observation Date. Reference Asset Closing Value on Relevant Observation Date SPX Index 80.00 RTY Index 69.00 NDX Index 50.00 Because the Closing Value of at least one Reference Asset is less than its Coupon Barrier Value, you will not receive a Contingent Coupon on the related Contingent Coupon Payment Date. Example 3: The Closing Value of each Reference Asset is less than its Coupon Barrier Value on the relevant Observation Date. Reference Asset Closing Value on Relevant Observation Date SPX Index 68.00 RTY Index 50.00 NDX Index 45.00 Because the Closing Value of at least one Reference Asset is less than its Coupon Barrier Value, you will not receive a Contingent Coupon on the related Contingent Coupon Payment Date. Examples 2 and 3 demonstrate that you may not receive a Contingent Coupon on a Contingent Coupon Payment Date. If the Closing Value of any Reference Asset is below its Coupon Barrier Value on each Observation Date, you will not receive any Contingent Coupons during the term of the Notes. PS—9 HYPOTHETICAL EXAMPLES OF AMOUNTS PAYABLE AT MATURITY The following table illustrates the hypothetical payment at maturity under various circumstances. The examples set forth below are purely hypothetical and are provided for illustrative purposes only. The numbers appearing in the following table and examples have been rounded for ease of analysis. The hypothetical examples below do not take into account any tax consequences from investing in the Notes and make the following key assumptions: ■ Hypothetical Initial Value of each Reference Asset: 100.00* ■ Hypothetical Coupon Barrier Value for each Reference Asset: 70.00 (70.00% of the hypothetical Initial Value set forth above)* ■ Hypothetical Barrier Value for each Reference Asset: 70.00 (70.00% of the hypothetical Initial Value set forth above)* ■ You hold the Notes to maturity, and the Notes are NOT redeemed prior to scheduled maturity. * The hypothetical Initial Value of 100.00, the hypothetical Coupon Barrier Value of 70.00 and the hypothetical Barrier Value of 70.00 for each Reference Asset have been chosen for illustrative purposes only. The actual Initial Value, Coupon Barrier Value and Barrier Value for each Reference Asset are as set forth on the cover of this pricing supplement.

The following examples illustrate how the payments at maturity set forth in the table above are calculated: Example 1: The Final Value of Reference Asset A is 135.00, the Final Value of Reference Asset B is 130.00 and the Final Value of Reference Asset C is 140.00. Because Reference Asset B has the lowest Reference Asset Return, Reference Asset B is the Least Performing Reference Asset. Because the Final Value of the Least Performing Reference Asset is greater than or equal to its Barrier Value, you will receive a payment at maturity of $1,000 per $1,000 principal amount Note that you hold (plus the Contingent Coupon that will otherwise be payable on the Maturity Date). PS—10 Example 2: The Final Value of Reference Asset A is 140.00, the Final Value of Reference Asset B is 90.00 and the Final Value of Reference Asset C is 105.00. Because Reference Asset B has the lowest Reference Asset Return, Reference Asset B is the Least Performing Reference Asset. Because the Final Value of the Least Performing Reference Asset is greater than or equal to its Barrier Value, you will receive a payment at maturity of $1,000 per $1,000 principal amount Note that you hold (plus the Contingent Coupon that will otherwise be payable on the Maturity Date). Example 3: The Final Value of Reference Asset A is 60.00, the Final Value of Reference Asset B is 120.00 and the Final Value of Reference Asset C is 100.00. Because Reference Asset A has the lowest Reference Asset Return, Reference Asset A is the Least Performing Reference Asset. Because the Final Value of the Least Performing Reference Asset is less than its Barrier Value, you will receive a payment at maturity of $600.00 per $1,000 principal amount Note that you hold, calculated as follows: $1,000 + [$1,000 × Reference Asset Return of the Least Performing Reference Asset] $1,000 + [$1,000 × -40.00%] = $600.00 In addition, because the Final Value of at least one Reference Asset is less than its Coupon Barrier Value, you will not receive a Contingent Coupon on the Maturity Date. Example 3 demonstrates that if the Notes are not redeemed prior to scheduled maturity, and if the Final Value of the Least Performing Reference Asset is less than its Barrier Value, your investment in the Notes will be fully exposed to the decline of the Least Performing Reference Asset from its Initial Value. You will not benefit in any way from the Reference Asset Return of any other Reference Asset being higher than the Reference Asset Return of the Least Performing Reference Asset. If the Notes are not redeemed prior to scheduled maturity, you may lose up to 100.00% of the principal amount of your Notes. Any payment on the Notes, including the repayment of principal, is subject to the credit risk of Barclays Bank PLC. PS—11 SELECTED RISK CONSIDERATIONS An investment in the Notes involves significant risks. Investing in the Notes is not equivalent to investing directly in the Reference Assets or their components, if any. Some of the risks that apply to an investment in the Notes are summarized below, but we urge you to read the more detailed explanation of risks relating to the Notes generally in the “Risk Factors” section of the prospectus supplement. You should not purchase the Notes unless you understand and can bear the risks of investing in the Notes. Risks Relating to the Notes Generally ● Your Investment in the Notes May Result in a Significant Loss — The Notes differ from ordinary debt securities in that the Issuer will not necessarily repay the full principal amount of the Notes at maturity. If the Notes are not redeemed prior to scheduled maturity, and if the Final Value of the Least Performing Reference Asset is less than its Barrier Value, your Notes will be fully exposed to the decline of the Least Performing Reference Asset from its Initial Value. You may lose up to 100.00% of the principal amount of your Notes. ● Potential Return is Limited to the Contingent Coupons, If Any, and You Will Not Participate in Any Appreciation of Any Reference Asset — The potential positive return on the Notes is limited to the Contingent Coupons, if any, that may be payable during the term of the Notes. You will not participate in any appreciation in the value of any Reference Asset, which may be significant, even though you will be exposed to the depreciation in the value of the Least Performing Reference Asset if the Notes are not redeemed and the Final Value of the Least Performing Reference Asset is less than its Barrier Value. ● You May Not Receive Any Contingent Coupon Payments on the Notes — The Issuer will not necessarily make periodic coupon payments on the Notes. You will receive a Contingent Coupon on a Contingent Coupon Payment Date only if the Closing Value of each Reference Asset on the related Observation Date is greater than or equal to its respective Coupon Barrier Value. If the Closing Value of any Reference Asset on an Observation Date is less than its Coupon Barrier Value, you will not receive a Contingent Coupon on the related Contingent Coupon Payment Date. If the Closing Value of at least one Reference Asset is less than its respective Coupon Barrier Value on each Observation Date, you will not receive any Contingent Coupons during the term of the Notes. ● Because the Notes Are Linked to the Least Performing Reference Asset, You Are Exposed to Greater Risks of No Contingent Coupons and Sustaining a Significant Loss of Principal at Maturity Than If the Notes Were Linked to a Single Reference Asset — The risk that you will not receive any Contingent Coupons and lose a significant portion or all of your principal amount in the Notes at maturity is greater if you invest in the Notes as opposed to substantially similar securities that are linked to the performance of a single Reference Asset. With multiple Reference Assets, it is more likely that the Closing Value of at least one Reference Asset will be less than its Coupon Barrier Value on the specified Observation Dates or less than its Barrier Value on the Final Valuation Date, and therefore, it is more likely that you will not receive any Contingent Coupons and that you will suffer a significant loss of principal at maturity. Further, the performance of the Reference Assets may not be correlated or may be negatively correlated. The lower the correlation between multiple Reference Assets, the greater the potential for one of those Reference Assets to close below its Coupon Barrier Value or Barrier Value on an Observation Date or the Final Valuation Date, respectively. It is impossible to predict what the correlation among the Reference Assets will be over the term of the Notes. The Reference Assets represent different equity markets. These different equity markets may not perform similarly over the term of the Notes. Although the correlation of the Reference Assets’ performance may change over the term of the Notes, the Contingent Coupon rate is determined, in part, based on the correlation of the Reference Assets’ performance calculated using our internal models at the time when the terms of the Notes are finalized. A higher Contingent Coupon is generally associated with lower correlation of the Reference Assets, which reflects a greater potential for missed Contingent Coupons and for a loss of principal at maturity. ● You Are Exposed to the Market Risk of Each Reference Asset — Your return on the Notes is not linked to a basket consisting of the Reference Assets. Rather, it will be contingent upon the independent performance of each Reference Asset. Unlike an instrument with a return linked to a basket of underlying assets in which risk is mitigated and diversified among all the components of the basket, you will be exposed to the risks related to each Reference Asset. Poor performance by any Reference Asset over the term of the Notes may negatively affect your return and will not be offset or mitigated by any increases or lesser declines in the value of any other Reference Asset. To receive a Contingent Coupon, the Closing Value of each Reference Asset must be greater than or equal to its Coupon Barrier Value on the applicable Observation Date. In addition, if the Notes have not been redeemed prior to scheduled maturity, and if the Final Value of any Reference Asset is less than its Barrier Value, you will be exposed to the full decline in the Least Performing Reference Asset from its Initial Value. Accordingly, your investment is subject to the market risk of each Reference Asset. ● The Notes Are Subject to Volatility Risk — Volatility is a measure of the degree of variation in the price of an asset (or level of an index) over a period of time. The amount of any coupon payments that may be payable under the Notes is based on a number of factors, including the expected volatility of the Reference Assets. The amount of such coupon payments will be paid at a per annum rate that is higher than the fixed rate that we would pay on a conventional debt security of the same tenor and is higher than it otherwise would have been had the expected volatility of the Reference Assets been lower. As volatility of a Reference Asset increases, there will typically be a greater likelihood that (a) the Closing Value of that Reference Asset on one or more Observation Dates will be less than its Coupon Barrier Value and (b) the Final Value of that Reference Asset will be less than its Barrier Value. PS—12 Accordingly, you should understand that a higher coupon payment amount reflects, among other things, an indication of a greater likelihood that you will (a) not receive coupon payments with respect to one or more Observation Dates and/or (b) incur a loss of principal at maturity than would have been the case had the amount of such coupon payments been lower. In addition, actual volatility over the term of the Notes may be significantly higher than the expected volatility at the time the terms of the Notes were determined. If actual volatility is higher than expected, you will face an even greater risk that you will not receive coupon payments and/or that you will lose some or all of your principal at maturity for the reasons described above. ● Early Redemption and Reinvestment Risk — While the original term of the Notes is as indicated on the cover of this pricing supplement, the Notes may be redeemed prior to maturity, as described above, and the holding period over which you may receive any coupon payments that may be payable under the Notes could be as short as approximately three months. The Redemption Price that you would receive on a Call Settlement Date, together with any coupon payments that you may have received prior to the Call Settlement Date, may be less than the aggregate amount of payments that you would have received had the Notes not been redeemed. There is no guarantee that you would be able to reinvest the proceeds from an investment in the Notes in a comparable investment with a similar level of risk in the event the Notes are redeemed prior to the Maturity Date. No additional payments will be due after the relevant Call Settlement Date. The fact that the Notes may be redeemed prior to maturity may also adversely impact your ability to sell your Notes and the price at which they may be sold. It is more likely that we will redeem the Notes at our sole discretion prior to maturity to the extent that the expected interest payable on the Notes is greater than the interest that would be payable on other instruments issued by us of comparable maturity, terms and credit rating trading in the market. We are less likely to redeem the Notes prior to maturity when the expected interest payable on the Notes is less than the interest that would be payable on other comparable instruments issued by us, which includes when the value of any Reference Asset is less than its Coupon Barrier Value. Therefore, the Notes are more likely to remain outstanding when the expected interest payable on the Notes is less than what would be payable on other comparable instruments and when your risk of not receiving a Contingent Coupon is relatively higher. ● Any Payment on the Notes Will Be Determined Based on the Closing Values of the Reference Assets on the Dates Specified — Any payment on the Notes will be determined based on the Closing Values of the Reference Assets on the dates specified. You will not benefit from any more favorable values of the Reference Assets determined at any other time. ● Contingent Repayment of Any Principal Amount Applies Only at Maturity or upon Any Redemption — You should be willing to hold your Notes to maturity or any redemption. Although the Notes provide for the contingent repayment of the principal amount of your Notes at maturity, provided that the Final Value of the Least Performing Reference Asset is greater than or equal to its Barrier Value, or upon any redemption, if you sell your Notes prior to such time in the secondary market, if any, you may have to sell your Notes at a price that is less than the principal amount even if at that time the value of each Reference Asset has increased from its Initial Value. See “Many Economic and Market Factors Will Impact the Value of the Notes” below. ● Owning the Notes is Not the Same as Owning Any Reference Asset or Any Securities to which Any Reference Asset Provides Exposure — The return on the Notes may not reflect the return you would realize if you actually owned any Reference Asset or any securities to which any Reference Asset provides exposure. As a holder of the Notes, you will not have voting rights or rights to receive dividends or other distributions or any other rights that holders of any Reference Asset or any securities to which any Reference Asset provides exposure may have. ● Tax Treatment — Significant aspects of the tax treatment of the Notes are uncertain. You should consult your tax advisor about your tax situation. See “Tax Considerations” below. Risks Relating to the Issuer ● Credit of Issuer — The Notes are unsecured and unsubordinated debt obligations of the Issuer, Barclays Bank PLC, and are not, either directly or indirectly, an obligation of any third party. Any payment to be made on the Notes, including any repayment of principal, is subject to the ability of Barclays Bank PLC to satisfy its obligations as they come due and is not guaranteed by any third party. As a result, the actual and perceived creditworthiness of Barclays Bank PLC may affect the market value of the Notes, and in the event Barclays Bank PLC were to default on its obligations, you may not receive any amounts owed to you under the terms of the Notes. ● You May Lose Some or All of Your Investment If Any U.K. Bail-in Power Is Exercised by the Relevant U.K. Resolution Authority — Notwithstanding and to the exclusion of any other term of the Notes or any other agreements, arrangements or understandings between Barclays Bank PLC and any holder or beneficial owner of the Notes (or the Trustee on behalf of the holders of the Notes), by acquiring the Notes, each holder and beneficial owner of the Notes acknowledges, accepts, agrees to be bound by, and consents to the exercise of, any U.K. Bail-in Power by the relevant U.K. resolution authority as set forth under “Consent to U.K. Bail-in Power” in this pricing supplement. Accordingly, any U.K. Bail-in Power may be exercised in such a manner as to result in you and other holders and beneficial owners of the Notes losing all or a part of the value of your investment in the Notes or receiving a different security from the Notes, which may be worth significantly less than the Notes and which may have significantly fewer protections than those typically afforded to debt securities. Moreover, the relevant U.K. resolution authority may exercise the U.K. Bail-in Power without providing any advance notice to, or requiring the consent of, the holders and beneficial owners of the Notes. The exercise of any U.K. Bail-in Power by the relevant U.K. resolution authority with respect to the Notes will not be a default or an Event of Default (as each term is defined in the senior debt securities indenture) and the trustee will not be liable for any action that the trustee takes, or abstains from taking, in either PS—13 case, in accordance with the exercise of the U.K. Bail-in Power by the relevant U.K. resolution authority with respect to the Notes. See “Consent to U.K. Bail-in Power” in this pricing supplement as well as “U.K. Bail-in Power,” “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to the Securities Generally—Regulatory action in the event a bank or investment firm in the Group is failing or likely to fail, including the exercise by the relevant U.K. resolution authority of a variety of statutory resolution powers, could materially adversely affect the value of any securities” and “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to the Securities Generally—Under the terms of the securities, you have agreed to be bound by the exercise of any U.K. Bail-in Power by the relevant U.K. resolution authority” in the accompanying prospectus supplement. Risks Relating to the Reference Assets ● Historical Performance of the Reference Assets Should Not Be Taken as Any Indication of the Future Performance of the Reference Assets Over the Term of the Notes — The value of each Reference Asset has fluctuated in the past and may, in the future, experience significant fluctuations. The historical performance of a Reference Asset is not an indication of the future performance of that Reference Asset over the term of the Notes. The historical correlation among the Reference Assets is not an indication of the future correlation among them over the term of the Notes. Therefore, the performance of the Reference Assets individually or in comparison to each other over the term of the Notes may bear no relation or resemblance to the historical performance of any Reference Asset. ● Each Reference Asset Reflects the Price Return of the Securities Composing that Reference Asset, Not the Total Return — The return on the Notes is based on the performance of the Reference Assets, which reflects changes in the market prices of the securities composing the Reference Assets. The Reference Assets are not \"total return\" indices that, in addition to reflecting those price returns, would also reflect dividends paid on the securities composing that Reference Asset. Accordingly, the return on the Notes will not include such a total return feature. ● Adjustments to Any Reference Asset Could Adversely Affect the Value of the Notes — The sponsor of any Reference Asset may add, delete, substitute or adjust the securities composing that Reference Asset or make other methodological changes to that Reference Asset that could affect its value. The Calculation Agent will calculate the value to be used as the Closing Value of that Reference Asset in the event of certain material changes in or modifications to that Reference Asset. In addition, the sponsor of any Reference Asset may also discontinue or suspend calculation or publication of that Reference Asset at any time. Under these circumstances, the Calculation Agent may select a successor index that the Calculation Agent determines to be comparable to that Reference Asset or, if no successor index is available, the Calculation Agent will determine the value to be used as the Closing Value of that Reference Asset. Any of these actions could adversely affect the value of any Reference Asset and, consequently, the value of the Notes. See “Reference Assets—Indices—Adjustments Relating to Securities with an Index as a Reference Asset” in the accompanying prospectus supplement. ● The Notes Are Subject to Risks Associated with Non-U.S. Securities Markets — Certain component securities of the NDX Index are issued by non-U.S. companies in non-U.S. securities markets. Investments in securities linked to the value of such non-U.S. equity securities, such as the Notes, involve risks associated with the securities markets in the home countries of the issuers of those non-U.S. equity securities, including risks of volatility in those markets, governmental intervention in those markets and cross shareholdings in companies in certain countries. Also, there is generally less publicly available information about companies in some of these jurisdictions than there is about U.S. companies that are subject to the reporting requirements of the SEC, and generally non-U.S. companies are subject to accounting, auditing and financial reporting standards and requirements and securities trading rules different from those applicable to U.S. reporting companies. The prices of securities in non-U.S. markets may be affected by political, economic, financial and social factors in those countries, or global regions, including changes in government, economic and fiscal policies and currency exchange laws. ● The Notes Are Subject to Risks Associated with Small Capitalization Stocks — The RTY Index tracks companies that are considered small-capitalization companies. These companies often have greater stock price volatility, lower trading volume and less liquidity than large-capitalization companies, and therefore securities linked to the RTY Index may be more volatile than an investment linked to an index with component stocks issued by large-capitalization companies. Stock prices of small-capitalization companies are also more vulnerable than those of large-capitalization companies to adverse business and economic developments. In addition, small-capitalization companies are typically less stable financially than large-capitalization companies and may depend on a small number of key personnel, making them more vulnerable to loss of personnel. Small-capitalization companies are often subject to less analyst coverage and may be in early, and less predictable, periods of their corporate existences. Such companies tend to have smaller revenues, less diverse product lines, smaller shares of their product or service markets, fewer financial resources and less competitive strengths than large-capitalization companies and are more susceptible to adverse developments related to their products. Risks Relating to Conflicts of Interest ● We and Our Affiliates May Engage in Various Activities or Make Determinations That Could Materially Affect the Notes in Various Ways and Create Conflicts of Interest — We and our affiliates play a variety of roles in connection with the issuance of the Notes, as described below. In performing these roles, our and our affiliates’ economic interests are potentially adverse to your interests as an investor in the Notes. In connection with our normal business activities and in connection with hedging our obligations under the Notes, we and our affiliates make markets in and trade various financial instruments or products for our accounts and for the account of our clients and otherwise provide investment banking and other financial services with respect to these financial instruments and products. PS—14 These financial instruments and products may include securities, derivative instruments or assets that may relate to the Reference Assets or their components, if any. In any such market making, trading and hedging activity, and other financial services, we or our affiliates may take positions or take actions that are inconsistent with, or adverse to, the investment objectives of the holders of the Notes. We and our affiliates have no obligation to take the needs of any buyer, seller or holder of the Notes into account in conducting these activities. Such market making, trading and hedging activity, investment banking and other financial services may negatively impact the value of the Notes. In addition, the role played by Barclays Capital Inc., as the agent for the Notes, could present significant conflicts of interest with the role of Barclays Bank PLC, as issuer of the Notes. For example, Barclays Capital Inc. or its representatives may derive compensation or financial benefit from the distribution of the Notes and such compensation or financial benefit may serve as incentive to sell the Notes instead of other investments. Furthermore, we and our affiliates establish the offering price of the Notes for initial sale to the public, and the offering price is not based upon any independent verification or valuation. In addition to the activities described above, we will also act as the Calculation Agent for the Notes. As Calculation Agent, we will determine any values of the Reference Assets and make any other determinations necessary to calculate any payments on the Notes. In making these determinations, the Calculation Agent may be required to make discretionary judgements relating to the Reference Assets, including determining whether a market disruption event has occurred or whether certain adjustments to the Reference Assets or other terms of the Notes are necessary, as further described in the accompanying prospectus supplement. In making these discretionary judgments, our economic interests are potentially adverse to your interests as an investor in the Notes, and any of these determinations may adversely affect any payments on the Notes. Risks Relating to the Estimated Value of the Notes and the Secondary Market ● The Estimated Value of Your Notes is Expected to be Lower Than the Initial Issue Price of Your Notes — The estimated value of your Notes on the Initial Valuation Date is expected to be lower, and may be significantly lower, than the initial issue price of your Notes. The difference between the initial issue price of your Notes and the estimated value of the Notes is a result of certain factors, such as any sales commissions to be paid to Barclays Capital Inc. or another affiliate of ours, any selling concessions, discounts, commissions or fees (including any structuring or other distribution related fees) to be allowed or paid to non-affiliated intermediaries, the estimated profit that we or any of our affiliates expect to earn in connection with structuring the Notes, the estimated cost which we may incur in hedging our obligations under the Notes, and estimated development and other costs which we may incur in connection with the Notes. ● The Estimated Value of Your Notes Might be Lower if Such Estimated Value Were Based on the Levels at Which Our Debt Securities Trade in the Secondary Market — The estimated value of your Notes on the Initial Valuation Date is based on a number of variables, including our internal funding rates. Our internal funding rates may vary from the levels at which our benchmark debt securities trade in the secondary market. As a result of this difference, the estimated value referenced above might be lower if such estimated value were based on the levels at which our benchmark debt securities trade in the secondary market. ● The Estimated Value of the Notes is Based on Our Internal Pricing Models, Which May Prove to be Inaccurate and May be Different from the Pricing Models of Other Financial Institutions — The estimated value of your Notes on the Initial Valuation Date is based on our internal pricing models, which take into account a number of variables and are based on a number of subjective assumptions, which may or may not materialize. These variables and assumptions are not evaluated or verified on an independent basis. Further, our pricing models may be different from other financial institutions’ pricing models and the methodologies used by us to estimate the value of the Notes may not be consistent with those of other financial institutions which may be purchasers or sellers of Notes in the secondary market. As a result, the secondary market price of your Notes may be materially different from the estimated value of the Notes determined by reference to our internal pricing models. ● The Estimated Value of Your Notes Is Not a Prediction of the Prices at Which You May Sell Your Notes in the Secondary Market, if any, and Such Secondary Market Prices, If Any, Will Likely be Lower Than the Initial Issue Price of Your Notes and May be Lower Than the Estimated Value of Your Notes — The estimated value of the Notes will not be a prediction of the prices at which Barclays Capital Inc., other affiliates of ours or third parties may be willing to purchase the Notes from you in secondary market transactions (if they are willing to purchase, which they are not obligated to do). The price at which you may be able to sell your Notes in the secondary market at any time will be influenced by many factors that cannot be predicted, such as market conditions, and any bid and ask spread for similar sized trades, and may be substantially less than our estimated value of the Notes. Further, as secondary market prices of your Notes take into account the levels at which our debt securities trade in the secondary market, and do not take into account our various costs related to the Notes such as fees, commissions, discounts, and the costs of hedging our obligations under the Notes, secondary market prices of your Notes will likely be lower than the initial issue price of your Notes. As a result, the price at which Barclays Capital Inc., other affiliates of ours or third parties may be willing to purchase the Notes from you in secondary market transactions, if any, will likely be lower than the price you paid for your Notes, and any sale prior to the Maturity Date could result in a substantial loss to you. ● The Temporary Price at Which We May Initially Buy The Notes in the Secondary Market And the Value We May Initially Use for Customer Account Statements, If We Provide Any Customer Account Statements At All, May Not Be Indicative of Future Prices of Your Notes — Assuming that all relevant factors remain constant after the Initial Valuation Date, the price at which Barclays Capital Inc. may initially buy or sell the Notes in the secondary market (if Barclays Capital Inc. makes a market in the Notes, which it is not obligated to do) and the value that we may initially use for customer account PS—15 statements, if we provide any customer account statements at all, may exceed our estimated value of the Notes on the Initial Valuation Date, as well as the secondary market value of the Notes, for a temporary period after the initial Issue Date of the Notes. The price at which Barclays Capital Inc. may initially buy or sell the Notes in the secondary market and the value that we may initially use for customer account statements may not be indicative of future prices of your Notes. ● Lack of Liquidity — The Notes will not be listed on any securities exchange. Barclays Capital Inc. and other affiliates of Barclays Bank PLC intend to make a secondary market for the Notes but are not required to do so, and may discontinue any such secondary market making at any time, without notice. Barclays Capital Inc. may at any time hold unsold inventory, which may inhibit the development of a secondary market for the Notes. Even if there is a secondary market, it may not provide enough liquidity to allow you to trade or sell the Notes easily. Because other dealers are not likely to make a secondary market for the Notes, the price at which you may be able to trade your Notes is likely to depend on the price, if any, at which Barclays Capital Inc. and other affiliates of Barclays Bank PLC are willing to buy the Notes. The Notes are not designed to be short-term trading instruments. Accordingly, you should be willing and able to hold your Notes to maturity. ● Many Economic and Market Factors Will Impact the Value of the Notes — The value of the Notes will be affected by a number of economic and market factors that interact in complex and unpredictable ways and that may either offset or magnify each other, including: o the market price of, dividend rate on and expected volatility of the Reference Assets or the components of the Reference Assets, if any; o correlation (or lack of correlation) of the Reference Assets; o the time to maturity of the Notes; o interest and yield rates in the market generally; o a variety of economic, financial, political, regulatory or judicial events; o supply and demand for the Notes; and o our creditworthiness, including actual or anticipated downgrades in our credit ratings.

Historical Performance of the Nasdaq-100 Index® PAST PERFORMANCE IS NOT INDICATIVE OF FUTURE RESULTS PS—19 TAX CONSIDERATIONS You should review carefully the sections in the accompanying prospectus supplement entitled “Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences—Tax Consequences to U.S. Holders—Notes Treated as Prepaid Forward or Derivative Contracts with Associated Contingent Coupons” and, if you are a non-U.S. holder, “—Tax Consequences to Non-U.S. Holders.” The following discussion supersedes the discussion in the accompanying prospectus supplement to the extent it is inconsistent therewith. In determining our reporting responsibilities, if any, we intend to treat (i) the Notes for U.S. federal income tax purposes as prepaid forward contracts with associated contingent coupons and (ii) any Contingent Coupon payments as ordinary income, as described in the section entitled “Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences—Tax Consequences to U.S. Holders—Notes Treated as Prepaid Forward or Derivative Contracts with Associated Contingent Coupons” in the accompanying prospectus supplement. Our special tax counsel, Davis Polk & Wardwell LLP, has advised that it believes this treatment to be reasonable, but that there are other reasonable treatments that the Internal Revenue Service (the “IRS”) or a court may adopt. Sale, exchange or redemption of a Note. Assuming the treatment described above is respected, upon a sale or exchange of the Notes (including upon early redemption or redemption at maturity), you should recognize capital gain or loss equal to the difference between the amount realized on the sale or exchange and your tax basis in the Notes, which should equal the amount you paid to acquire the Notes (assuming Contingent Coupon payments are properly treated as ordinary income, consistent with the position referred to above). This gain or loss should be short-term capital gain or loss unless you hold the Notes for more than one year, in which case the gain or loss should be long-term capital gain or loss, whether or not you are an initial purchaser of the Notes at the issue price. The deductibility of capital losses is subject to limitations. If you sell your Notes between the time your right to a Contingent Coupon payment is fixed and the time it is paid, it is likely that you will be treated as receiving ordinary income equal to the Contingent Coupon payment. Although uncertain, it is possible that proceeds received from the sale or exchange of your Notes prior to an Observation Date but that can be attributed to an expected Contingent Coupon payment could be treated as ordinary income. You should consult your tax advisor regarding this issue. As noted above, there are other reasonable treatments that the IRS or a court may adopt, in which case the timing and character of any income or loss on the Notes could be materially affected. In addition, in 2007 the U.S. Treasury Department and the IRS released a notice requesting comments on the U.S. federal income tax treatment of “prepaid forward contracts” and similar instruments. The notice focuses in particular on whether to require investors in these instruments to accrue income over the term of their investment. It also asks for comments on a number of related topics, including the character of income or loss with respect to these instruments and the relevance of factors such as the nature of the underlying property to which the instruments are linked. While the notice requests comments on appropriate transition rules and effective dates, any Treasury regulations or other guidance promulgated after consideration of these issues could materially affect the tax consequences of an investment in the Notes, possibly with retroactive effect. You should consult your tax advisor regarding the U.S. federal income tax consequences of an investment in the Notes, including possible alternative treatments and the issues presented by this notice. Non-U.S. holders. Insofar as we have responsibility as a withholding agent, we do not currently intend to treat Contingent Coupon payments to non-U.S. holders (as defined in the accompanying prospectus supplement) as subject to U.S. withholding tax. However, non-U.S. holders should in any event expect to be required to provide appropriate Forms W-8 or other documentation in order to establish an exemption from backup withholding, as described under the heading “—Information Reporting and Backup Withholding” in the accompanying prospectus supplement. If any withholding is required, we will not be required to pay any additional amounts with respect to amounts withheld. Treasury regulations under Section 871(m) generally impose a withholding tax on certain “dividend equivalents” under certain “equity linked instruments.” A recent IRS notice excludes from the scope of Section 871(m) instruments issued prior to January 1, 2025 that do not have a “delta of one” with respect to underlying securities that could pay U.S.-source dividends for U.S. federal income tax purposes (each an “Underlying Security”). Based on our determination that the Notes do not have a “delta of one” within the meaning of the regulations, we expect that these regulations will not apply to the Notes with regard to non-U.S. holders. Our determination is not binding on the IRS, and the IRS may disagree with this determination. Section 871(m) is complex and its application may depend on your particular circumstances, including whether you enter into other transactions with respect to an Underlying Security. If necessary, further information regarding the potential application of Section 871(m) will be provided in the pricing supplement for the Notes. You should consult your tax advisor regarding the potential application of Section 871(m) to the Notes. PS—20 SUPPLEMENTAL PLAN OF DISTRIBUTION We will agree to sell to Barclays Capital Inc. (the “Agent”), and the Agent will agree to purchase from us, the principal amount of the Notes, and at the price, specified on the cover of this pricing supplement. The Agent will commit to take and pay for all of the Notes, if any are taken. PS—21\n"
